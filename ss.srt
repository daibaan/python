Please visit us at stanford.edu

3
00:00:4.992 --> 00:00:12.519
Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement

4
00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.237
from one of the finest universities in the world.

5
00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:24.058
Truth be told I never graduated from college

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.429
and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.

7
00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.509
Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it.

8
00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:37.348
No big deal. Just three stories.

9
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.069
The first story is about connecting the dots.

10
00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:46.393
I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months,

11
00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.298
but then stayed around as a drop-in

12
00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.228
for another 18 months or so before I really quit.

13
00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.578
So why did I drop out?

14
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.868
It started before I was born.

15
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:1.534
My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student,

16
00:01:1.739 --> 00:01:3.848
and she decided to put me up for adoption.

17
00:01:4.859 --> 00:01:8.727
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates,

18
00:01:8.808 --> 00:01:11.108
so everything was all set for me to

19
00:01:11.108 --> 00:01:13.597
be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

20
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:16.649
Except that when I popped out they decided

21
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.049
at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.

22
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.549
So my parents, who were on a waiting list,

23
00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.968
got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected

24
00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.418
baby boy; do you want him?"

25
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.574
They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that

26
00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.808
my mother had never graduated from college

27
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.969
and that my father had never graduated from high school.

28
00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.948
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.

29
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.889
She only relented a few months later when

30
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.009
my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.

31
00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:1.838
And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college

32
00:02:1.840 --> 00:02:4.158
that was almost as expensive as Stanford,

33
00:02:4.969 --> 00:02:6.808
and all of my working-class parents'

34
00:02:6.810 --> 00:02:9.278
savings were being spent on my college tuition.

35
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.909
After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.

36
00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.258
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life

37
00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.878
and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.

38
00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.588
And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved

39
00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:23.399
their entire life.

40
00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.437
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.

41
00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:31.897
It was pretty scary at the time,

42
00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.307
but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

43
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.189
The minute I dropped out I could stop

44
00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.984
taking the required classes that didn't interest me,

45
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.099
and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.

46
00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:50.598
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room,

47
00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.997
so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms,

48
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.679
I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with,

49
00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.778
and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday

50
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:3.579
night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna

51
00:03:3.650 --> 00:03:5.579
temple. I loved it.

52
00:03:6.349 --> 00:03:8.758
And much of what I stumbled into by following

53
00:03:8.759 --> 00:03:12.188
my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.

54
00:03:12.188 --> 00:03:16.873
Let me give you one example: Reed College at that

55
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.489
time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.

56
00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.247
Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer,

57
00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:27.608
was beautifully hand calligraphed.

58
00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.388
Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes,

59
00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.179
I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.

60
00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.593
I learned about serif and san serif typefaces,

61
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.449
about varying the amount of space

62
00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.163
between different letter combinations,

63
00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.899
about what makes great typography great.

64
00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.079
It was beautiful, historical,

65
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.679
artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture,

66
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.948
and I found it fascinating.

67
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.298
None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.

68
00:04:0.069 --> 00:04:1.274
But ten years later,

69
00:04:1.370 --> 00:04:4.129
when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,

70
00:04:4.379 --> 00:04:7.968
it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.

71
00:04:7.970 --> 00:04:11.439
It was the first computer with beautiful typography.

72
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.269
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,

73
00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.088
the Mac would have never had multiple

74
00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.613
typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.

75
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.113
And since Windows just copied the Mac,

76
00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.015
it's likely that no personal computer would have them.

77
00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.639
If I had never dropped out,

78
00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.538
I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,

79
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.649
and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography

80
00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:43.019
that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect

81
00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:44.948
the dots looking forward when I was in college.

82
00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.149
But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.

83
00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.649
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward;

84
00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:54.998
you can only connect them looking backwards.

85
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.049
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect

86
00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:58.943
in your future.

87
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:3.229
You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma,

88
00:05:3.230 --> 00:05:3.939
whatever.

89
00:05:4.850 --> 00:05:10.598
Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart

90
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.846
Even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference.

91
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.199
My second story is about love and loss.

92
00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.428
I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life.

93
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.019
Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20.

94
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.759
We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of

95
00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.079
us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.

96
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.849
We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh

97
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.139
a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.

98
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.449
And then I got fired.

99
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.399
How can you get fired from a company you started?

100
00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:58.399
Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought

101
00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:0.959
was very talented to run the company with me,

102
00:06:1.180 --> 00:06:2.968
and for the first year or so things went well.

103
00:06:2.970 --> 00:06:5.179
But then our visions of the future began

104
00:06:5.180 --> 00:06:8.239
to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.

105
00:06:8.269 --> 00:06:11.168
When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.

106
00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:15.228
So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out.

107
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.389
What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone,

108
00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.199
and it was devastating.

109
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.138
I really didn't know what to do for a few months.

110
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.369
I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs

111
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.709
down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.

112
00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:32.988
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce

113
00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:36.199
and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.

114
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.338
I was a very public failure,

115
00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:40.588
and I even thought about running away from the valley.

116
00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:45.889
But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did.

117
00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:50.298
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.

118
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.468
I had been rejected, but I was still in love.

119
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:56.338
And so I decided to start over.

120
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:0.409
I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from

121
00:07:0.410 --> 00:07:2.819
Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.

122
00:07:3.509 --> 00:07:5.688
The heaviness of being successful was

123
00:07:5.689 --> 00:07:8.524
replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again,

124
00:07:8.720 --> 00:07:9.659
less sure about everything.

125
00:07:9.660 --> 00:07:13.399
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

126
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.848
During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT,

127
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:18.388
another company named Pixar,

128
00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:21.579
and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.

129
00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:25.108
Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature

130
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.604
film, Toy Story,

131
00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:32.478
and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

132
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.299
In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT,

133
00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.209
I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at

134
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.938
NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.

135
00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:45.278
And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

136
00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:48.249
I'm pretty sure none of this would

137
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.249
have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.

138
00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:54.388
It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

139
00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:0.358
Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.

140
00:08:0.800 --> 00:08:3.709
I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved

141
00:08:3.709 --> 00:08:6.803
what I did. You've got to find what you love.

142
00:08:7.040 --> 00:08:9.968
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.

143
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.598
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,

144
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.947
and the only way to be truly satisfied

145
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.307
is to do what you believe is great work.

146
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.956
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

147
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.619
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.

148
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.009
As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

149
00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.433
And, like any great relationship,

150
00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:34.493
it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

151
00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:38.649
So keep looking. Don't settle.

152
00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:50.988
My third story is about death.

153
00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:55.028
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:

154
00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:58.254
"If you live each day as if it was your last,

155
00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:0.468
someday you'll most certainly be right."

156
00:09:3.360 --> 00:09:7.859
It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years,

157
00:09:8.019 --> 00:09:9.639
I have looked in the mirror every morning

158
00:09:9.639 --> 00:09:12.519
and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life,

159
00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:16.218
would I want to do what I am about to do today?"

160
00:09:16.809 --> 00:09:20.168
And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row,

161
00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:22.058
I know I need to change something.

162
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.429
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important

163
00:09:26.429 --> 00:09:29.708
tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

164
00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:35.213
Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride,

165
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:37.144
all fear of embarrassment or failure -

166
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.219
these things just fall away in the face of death,

167
00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:42.778
leaving only what is truly important.

168
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.169
Remembering that you are going to die is the best

169
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:50.228
way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

170
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.069
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

171
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.479
About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.

172
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:2.663
I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning,

173
00:10:2.779 --> 00:10:5.568
and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.

174
00:10:6.100 --> 00:10:8.109
I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

175
00:10:8.769 --> 00:10:11.038
The doctors told me this was almost

176
00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:13.288
certainly a type of cancer that is incurable,

177
00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:17.568
and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.

178
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.569
My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,

179
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.409
which is doctor's code for prepare to die.

180
00:10:25.409 --> 00:10:30.458
It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought

181
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.668
you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.

182
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.249
It means to make sure everything is buttoned

183
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.208
up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.

184
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.949
It means to say your goodbyes.

185
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.079
I lived with that diagnosis all day.

186
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:48.833
Later that evening I had a biopsy,

187
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.134
where they stuck an endoscope down my throat,

188
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.504
through my stomach and into my intestines,

189
00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:56.979
put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.

190
00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:0.829
I was sedated, but my wife, who was there,

191
00:11:1.049 --> 00:11:4.008
told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope

192
00:11:4.240 --> 00:11:6.999
the doctors started crying because it turned out to be

193
00:11:7.000 --> 00:11:10.969
a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.

194
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.615
I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.

195
00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:25.803
This was the closest I've been to facing death,

196
00:11:26.059 --> 00:11:28.938
and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades.

197
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.619
Having lived through it,

198
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.749
I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when

199
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.817
death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:

200
00:11:37.918 --> 00:11:40.369
No one wants to die.

201
00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:44.889
Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.

202
00:11:44.889 --> 00:11:48.318
And yet death is the destination we all share.

203
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.674
No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be,

204
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.989
because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.

205
00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.083
It is Life's change agent.

206
00:11:59.129 --> 00:12:1.548
It clears out the old to make way for the new.

207
00:12:2.370 --> 00:12:6.979
Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now,

208
00:12:7.070 --> 00:12:10.259
you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.

209
00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:13.507
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

210
00:12:14.649 --> 00:12:19.788
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.

211
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.908
Don't be trapped by dogma which is living

212
00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:25.098
with the results of other people's thinking.

213
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:28.688
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner

214
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.949
voice. And most important,

215
00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:33.778
have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

216
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.849
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

217
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.698
Everything else is secondary.

218
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.408
When I was young,

219
00:12:53.789 --> 00:12:57.583
there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog,

220
00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:0.288
which was one of the bibles of my generation.

221
00:13:0.759 --> 00:13:4.269
It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here

222
00:13:4.269 --> 00:13:7.978
in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.

223
00:13:8.339 --> 00:13:10.089
This was in the late 1960's,

224
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.673
before personal computers and desktop publishing,

225
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.839
so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.

226
00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:19.438
It was sort of like Google in paperback form,

227
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.844
35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic,

228
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.049
overflowing with neat tools, and great notions.

229
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.589
Stewart and his team put out several

230
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:30.979
issues of The Whole Earth Catalog,

231
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.408
and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.

232
00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:39.619
It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.

233
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.928
On the back cover of their final issue

234
00:13:42.929 --> 00:13:46.568
was a photograph of an early morning country road,

235
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.819
the kind you might find yourself

236
00:13:47.818 --> 00:13:50.688
hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.

237
00:13:51.429 --> 00:13:55.638
Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."

238
00:13:55.639 --> 00:14:0.729
It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry.

239
00:14:1.059 --> 00:14:5.228
Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself.

240
00:14:6.250 --> 00:14:11.038
And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

241
00:14:11.179 --> 00:14:14.107
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

242
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.352
Thank you all very much.
