Alright now! you all fresh niggers,

3
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:15,000

Cut my tops..

7
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,600
Throw it on the pile...

Now...them cane ain't gonna jump up

14
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,700
Get in there, boy .

15
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,250
Come on.

16
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,350
Give me a kiss .

17
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,250
I love you .
- I love you too, Dad .

18
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,350
Sleep well.

19
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,500
I'll take this.

20
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,650
I don't wanna hear anymore noise.

21
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,550
Good night .

22
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,950
Three weeks and two days.

23
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,250
It is the custom.

24
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,400
I wonder what you'll do without me?

25
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,950
I won't stay idle.

26
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,050
Darling, it's good money.

27
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,800
If only I didn't have to share your cooking
with other people.

28
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,800
You don't.

29
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,200
Come on.

30
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,700
Be good for your mother.

31
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,600
Ok , Alonzo ?

32
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,400
Can I get a kiss, please?
Thank you.

33
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,000
Travel safely, love.
- Stay safely.

34
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,450
Ready.

35
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,050
Good afternoon, Mr. Nortap .
- Good day .

36
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,850
Call the Devil's name...
There he is now.

37
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,200
Mr. Northup...! I have two gentlemen
acquaintance you should make.

38
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,500
Messrs. Brown and Hamilton.

39
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,650
Sir .

40
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,350
Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen were
inquiring about distinguished individuals,

41
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,550
and I was just this very moment saying
Solomon Northup;

42
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,150
is an expert player on the violin.
- He was indeed.

43
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,050
Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.

44
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,150
Taking into consideration
his graciousness and your modesty,

45
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,300
may we trouble you for a moment
of your time to converse, sir?

46
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,950
Of course.

47
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,450
Sir .

48
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,850
A circus?
- That is our usual employee.

49
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,650
The company currently in
the city of Washington.

50
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,900
Circus too constricting
a word to describe the...

51
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,150
talented and merry band
with which we travel.

52
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,250
It is a spectacle unlike most
have ever witnessed.

53
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,336
Creatures from the darkest Africa
as yet unseen by civilized man.

54
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:36,900
Acrobats from the Orient contorting
themselves in the most confounding manners.

55
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,800
And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown;
an internationally renowned practitioner

56
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,400
...in the art of prestidigitation.

57
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,300
We are on our way thither
to rejoin the company...

58
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,895
having left for a short time to make
a small profit from our own exhibitions.

59
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:49,884
The reason for our
inquiry with Mr. Moon...

60
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,242
Yes. We had just a devil of a time in
procuring music for our entertainments.

61
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:55,387
Men of true talent seemingly
 in short supply.

62
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:56,225
- Thank you sir...

63
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,600
If we could persuade you to accompany us
as far as Washington...

64
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,200
We would give you one dollar
for each day's service'

65
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,650
and three dollars for every night
played at our performances.

66
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,599
In addition, we would
provide sufficient pay,

67
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,675
for the expenses of your
return here to Saratoga.

68
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,950
Two weeks from today.

69
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,250
Welcome to Washington, Solomon.

70
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,550
Thank you .

71
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,850
Good Day.

72
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,851
I'm telling you it's too much .
- Some would say that's enough .

73
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,650
Solomon ...

74
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,000
Forty-three dollars.
All to you.

75
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,100
That...it's far more
than my wages amount to.

76
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,050
To our most profitable week.
- Cheers !

77
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,650
Cheers !
- Cheers !

78
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,750
Another round.

79
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,450
Umm...

80
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,800
Your generosity ...

81
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,200
is ...extraordinary.
- And your talents are undeniable.

82
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,650
To Solomon !
- Cheers.

83
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,250
Cheers.

84
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,750
What the ... ?

85
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,200
That's all right Solomon.

86
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,800
No shame in it.
No shame at all.

87
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,450
Hamilton, we have to hurry .

88
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,400
Bought too many libation.

89
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,800
I'm so sorry .
- Shh...shh

90
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,750
We won't hear it.
We won't.

91
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,700
Let him sleep, Hamilton.
- Hm ...

92
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,850
A good night's rest.

93
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,550
And tomorrow...

94
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,450
Tomorrow, tomorrow you will feel
as well and refreshed..

95
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,450
as though the earth were new again.

96
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,350
Hamilton! There's nothing more
we can do for him.

97
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,900
Such is the pity.

98
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,150
Well, my boy,
how yah feel now?

99
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,750
My name...

100
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,100
My name is Solomon Northup.

101
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,250
I am a free man .

102
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,650
a resident of Saratoga, New York.

103
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,250
The residence also of my wife and children
who are equally free.

104
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,400
and you have no right
whatsoever to detain me--

105
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,400
Yah not any free man .
- And I promise you

106
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,400
- I promise you upon my liberation
I will have satisfaction for this wrong.

107
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,350
Resolve this.
Produce your papers.

108
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,200
Yah no free man.

109
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,700
And yah ain't from Saratoga.

110
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Yah from Georgia.

111
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Yah ain't a free man.

112
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,950
Yah nuthin' but a Georgia runaway.

113
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,800
Yah a just a..

114
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,844
runaway nigger from Georgia.

115
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,200
You're a slave !

116
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,800
Yah a Georgia slave!

117
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,550
Are yah slave?

118
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,150
No.

119
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,100
Help me !

120
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,150
Help me !

121
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,750
Somebody help me !

122
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,400
That old thing of yours is just
rags and tatters.

123
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Need something proper to wear.

124
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Go'on.  Put it on.

125
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,800
There ...

126
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,000
Tha's fine.

127
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,450
Tha's fine.

128
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,750
Got no gratitude?

129
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,350
No!  It was from my wife.
- Rags and tatters.

130
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,850
Rags and tatters.

131
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,050
Go on. Warsh up.

132
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,950
The boy, too.
Get him clean.

133
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,350
Scrub now.

134
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,200
Do you know when my Mama will come?

135
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,200
Hush him up!
- Mama! Mama !

136
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,600
Quiet! Quiet.
- Mama!

137
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,500
Quiet! - Hush him up!
-  Mama!

138
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,350
Your mother will come, I swear she will,
but you must be silent.

139
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,850
Be silent!

140
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,500
We need a sympathetic ear.

141
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,400
An opportunity to explain our situation--

142
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,930
Who in your estimation
is that sympathetic ear?

143
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:16,575
- The two men I journeyed with.

144
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,650
I'm certain they're making inquires
at this very moment.

145
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,196
I would be just as certain
they are counting the money,

146
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:21,325
paid for delivering
you to this place.

147
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,850
They were not kidnappers.
They were artists.

148
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,200
Fellow performers.
- You know that ?

149
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,850
You know for certain who they were?

150
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,300
The reality to come is us
being transported southward.

151
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,000
New Orleans if I were to venture.

152
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,600
After we arrive, we'll be put to market.

153
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,200
And beyond that...

154
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, once in a slave state
I suppose there's only one outcome.

155
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,600
No.

156
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,625
- I don't say that to give
you empty agitation, John...

157
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,970
For y'all. For y'all they
ain't nothin' but that!

158
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,175
But John was'n kidnapped.

159
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,750
John bein' hold as debt, tha's all.

160
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,750
Massa pay his debt,
and John be redeemed--

161
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,800
Boy, our masters will not come for us.
- Now John's...John's sorry for y'all,

162
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,500
but tha's how it be.
Where y'all goin', yah goin' witout John.

163
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,250
Mama !
- Randall.

164
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,250
Mama !

165
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,750
Are you alright?

166
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,450
Come on, get up !

167
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,250
I said get up !
- No, no ...

168
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,450
Now, I don't want to hear yer talk.
Get in the yard.

169
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,900
No, I'm not sure...
- Ain't no need for all that.

170
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,450
Just go on a short trip ,
That's all .

171
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,000
Don't want to frighten the children
none over a li'l boat ride, do yah?

172
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,900
John's massa gunna pay his debt.
John's massa gunna come for him.

173
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,600
I do not want to hear a word ,
out of none a yah.

174
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,200
Not a word.

175
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,100
No!

176
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,700
Okay , let's go!

177
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,600
Come on!

178
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,150
Come on child, come on.

179
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,750
Come on, move it !

180
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,000
Come on, come on!
Up, up the stairs.

181
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,850
Hit it !

182
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,450
Come on, let's go.

183
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,000
Get up !

184
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,650
Come on , move it !

185
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,950
Okay , let's go!
- Move it boy !

186
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,200
Take him down!

187
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,755
Hey, you ! Come on, get up!

188
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,850
Get down, right there .

189
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Come on.

190
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Right there.
Sit down.

191
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,950
Cheer up and don't be so cast down.

192
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:38,350
If you want to survive,
do and say as little as possible.

193
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,034
Tell no one who you really are,

194
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,825
and tell no one that you
can read and write.

195
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,700
Unless you want to be a dead nigger.

196
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,450
Now, keep your mouth shut.

197
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,400
I say we fight.

198
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,750
The crew is fairly small.

199
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,200
If it were well planned,
I believe they could be strong armed.

200
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,150
Three can’t stand against a whole crew.

201
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,550
The rest here are niggers,

202
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,400
born and bred slaves.
Niggers ain’t got the stomach for a fight.

203
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,800
Not a damn one.
- All I know,

204
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,650
where we keep travelling
we’ll wish we’d died trying.

205
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:43,550
- Survival is not about certain death,
it is about keeping your head down.

206
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Days ago I was with my family,

207
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,650
In my home.

208
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,750
Now you tell me all is lost.

209
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:02,050
“Tell no one who I really am”
if I want to survive.

210
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,650
Well ,I don’t want to survive,

211
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,800
I want to live.

212
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:44,750
Better off.
Better than us.

213
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,450
I do not see it .
Clemens !

214
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,550
Clemens Ray!

215
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,850
Master Ray, sir!

216
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,150
Who 's in charge here ?
- I'm the captain !

217
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,700
I am Mr. Jonas Ray.

218
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,000
My solicitor has documentation verifying..

219
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,150
that the Negro named
Clemens Ray is my property.

220
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,700
I know nothing of this arrangement.

221
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,436
You are ordered by court
to return that property,

222
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:22,675
immediately or be
charged with thievery.

223
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,550
Free him!

224
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,650
Master!

225
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,552
Clemens ?
Clemens !

226
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,950
Get back !
- Clemens !

227
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,800
Clemens !

228
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,300
Clemens !

229
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,000
Mr. Parker?

230
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,250
Oh , Mr. Northup.

231
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,000
Mrs. Northup. Mr. Solomon,
can i interest you with a new cravat?

232
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,950
Pure silk by way of the French.
- We are in need of a fresh carry all..

233
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,300
for the Mrs's travels. Nothing more.

234
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,450
A year's passed?
Off to Sandy Hill?

235
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,900
Yes , I am.
- I have just the thing for you .

236
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,577
Something to suit your style,

237
00:27:04,603 --> 00:27:07,375
but sturdy enough for the
forty miles round trip.

238
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,500
It's beautiful.
- But at what price ?

239
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,450
We will take it.

240
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,000
Children, come see what your father
has just purchased for me.

241
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,400
One moment, sir
and you will be assisted.

242
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,500
Mr. Parker ?
- Sir?

243
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,954
If we can talk about
the price ...

244
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,700
- If we could discuss the price;
Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.

245
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,800
A customer waits.
Welcome, sir.

246
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,700
Shop well, but mind your wallet.

247
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:29,400
Ignore the gentleman's nonsense.
- Jasper!

248
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
My regrets for the intrusion, sir .

249
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,400
- No intrusion.

250
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,200
Good day, sir.
-Good day.

251
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,800
Jasper , out!

252
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,800
Very good.

253
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,550
Let's see here ...
Eliza!

254
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,850
Stand up when you hear your name .
Eliza ?

255
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,750
Lethe!

256
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,550
John!

257
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,850
Oren.

258
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,400
Platt!

259
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,050
Platt?

260
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,550
Stand up.

261
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,750
You fit the description given.
Why didn't you answer when called?

262
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,850
- My name is not Platt.
My name is--

263
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,300
Your name is Platt.

264
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,650
Captain, get these niggers
to my carts .

265
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,900
I believe I have something that will
you just like the room behind .

266
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,900
Follow me, please.

267
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,600
Yes.
Now...

268
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,000
Inspect them at your leisure, but ...

269
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,750
I ask you to pay particular regard
to young Ezra right here .

270
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,500
Incredibly solid limbs !
I've never seen anything quite like him.

271
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,550
And this marvelous creature ...
Can you believe it? Hm ?

272
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,300
So , inspect at your leisure,
Take your time.

273
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,100
Help yourself to refreshments .

274
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,900
Gentlemen , what catches your fancy here?

275
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,650
Hm ... ? This boy ?

276
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,100
Open your mouth .
Open, wide up!

277
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,700
Look in there.
Never been sick, a day in his life.

278
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,100
ah, Mr. Ford?

279
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,500
Splendid, seeing you, sir.
What catches your fancy?

280
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,350
How much for the ones Platt and Eliza?

281
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,350
- Ah, I see ...

282
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,800
A thousand for Platt;
he is a nigger of considerable talent.

283
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,550
I assure you.
Seven hundred for Eliza.

284
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,187
My fairest price.

285
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:08,031
..you would accept a note?
- Please, sir...

286
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:11,124
- As always, from you, Mr. Ford.
- Please sir, don't divide my family.

287
00:30:11,124 --> 00:30:13,029
- Don't take me unless you take my children as well.
- Eliza, quiet!

288
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:15,075
- You will have the most
faithful slave in me,

289
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,300
The most faithful slave
that has ever lived,

290
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:19,284
but I beg that you do
not separate us. .

291
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,350
Please!
- Stop it!

292
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,250
Come forward. Come, come..come.
You see how fit the boy is.

293
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,050
Like ripe fruit.

294
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,450
May i take your stick,
for a moment?

295
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,150
Observe this, Randall?
Jump, jump, jump...!

296
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,650
Very good !
Higher!

297
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,400
He will grow into a fine beast.

298
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,500
How much?
- Six hundred for the boy,

299
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,650
fair and final.

300
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,000
Done.

301
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,600
A moment, please.

302
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,700
Mr. Ford ?
- Please.

303
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,600
Eliza !
- How much for the little girl?

304
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,150
You have no need for her.
One so young will bring you no profit.

305
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,950
No, no and no .
I cannot sell the girl.

306
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,700
There's heaps 'n piles of
money to be made off her.

307
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,100
She is a beauty.
One of the regular bloods.

308
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,150
None of your thick-lipped, bullet headed,
cotton picking niggers.

309
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,700
Her child, man.

310
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,200
For God's sake,
are you not sentimental in the least?

311
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:21,150
My sentimentality extends
the length of a coin.

312
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,650
Do you want the lot, Mr. Ford,
or do you pass on them all?

313
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,250
Please, please ...

314
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,150
I will take the ones Platt and Eliza.

315
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,074
I will not go without my children.
You will not take them from me.

316
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,300
No, no, no ...!

317
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,600
Did you bring all those niggers?

318
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,050
Two of them?

319
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,150
You got two?
- Mr. Chapin--

320
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,800
This one's cryin'.
Why is this one cryin'?

321
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,200
Separated from her children.
- Oh, dear ...

322
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,650
It couldn't be helped.
-Poor, poor woman.

323
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,000
Mr. Chapin,
- Yes , sir .

324
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,250
tomorrow you will take these two up
to the mill and start them workin'.

325
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,505
For now make them adequate;

326
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:38,600
fix them a meal, and have
them rest themselves.

327
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,700
Yes, sir .

328
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,850
C'mon, now.  C'mon.
Don't dawdle.

329
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,688
Something to eat and some rest;

330
00:32:47,714 --> 00:32:51,775
your children will soon
enough be forgotten.

331
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,500
For all of you rotten niggers that
do not know, My name is John Tibeats,

332
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,300
William Ford's chief carpenter.

333
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,800
You will refer to me as Master.

334
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,700
Now, Mister Chapin is the overseer on
this plantation.

335
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,800
... and You too will refer to him...

336
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,450
as Master.

337
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,150
So, clap your hands.

338
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,900
Like this.

339
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,100
Come on.
Come on now .

340
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,000
Clap your hands.

341
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,050
<i>Nigger run nigger flew</i>

342
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,650
<i>Nigger tore his shirt in two.</i>

343
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,050
<i>Run run the pattyroller will get you.</i>

344
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,150
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

345
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,700
That's right.

346
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,050
<i>Nigger run, run so fast</i>

347
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,450
<i>Stoved his head in a hornets nest</i>

348
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,900
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you</i>

349
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,200
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

350
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,700
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you</i>

351
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,300
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

352
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,150
<i>Some folks say a nigger won't steal</i>

353
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,500
<i>I caught three in my corn field</i>

354
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,800
<i>One has a bushel? And one has a peck</i>

355
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,250
<i>One had a rope and it was hung around his neck</i>

356
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,700
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you</i>

357
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,200
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

358
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,600
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you</i>

359
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,500
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

360
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,000
<i>Hey Mr. Pattyroller don't catch me</i>

361
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,400
<i>Catch that nigger behind that tree</i>

362
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,900
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you?</i>

363
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,200
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

364
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,550
<i>Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you?</i>

365
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,800
<i>Run nigger run well you better get away</i>

366
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:11,000
I am the God of Abraham,
and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

367
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:16,550
And when the multitude heard this,
they were astonished at his doctrine.

368
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,650
Then one of them, which was a lawyer,

369
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,200
asked him a question,
tempting him,

370
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,700
The creek is plenty deep enough to sail,

371
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,000
even with a boat full of load.

372
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,450
The distance from the WORK AREA
to the point on the latter bayou

373
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,450
... is several miles by water fewer than land.

374
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,700
It occurs to me that the expense
of the transportation would be materially diminished--

375
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,000
"Materially diminished?"
- If we use the waterway.

376
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,900
Are you an engineer or a nigger?

377
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,400
Are you an engineer or nigger?

378
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,400
Let the man say his piece.
- It's a scheme.

379
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,800
Plenty of engineers have schemed similarly.
The passes are too tight.

380
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,150
I reckon them at more than
twelve feet at their most narrow.

381
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,400
Wide enough for a tub to traverse.
A team of niggers can clear it out.

382
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,200
And you know what of transport and terra formin'?

383
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,600
I labored repairing the Champlain canal,

384
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,600
on the section over which
William Van Nortwick was superintendent.

385
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,650
With my earnings I hired several
efficient hands to assist me,

386
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,600
...and I entered into contracts for the transportation
of large rafts of timber from..

387
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,900
Lake Champlain to Troy.

388
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,850
I'll admit to being impressed even if you won't.

389
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,450
Collect a team, see what good you can do.

390
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,400
Well, I'm happy .
You are a model.

391
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,600
What took you so long ?

392
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,450
Thank you, Master Ford .
- No, thank you .

393
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,950
Yeah !

394
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,700
Hello, Mr. Platt .

395
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,000
My great thanks, Master Ford.

396
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,300
My thanks to you,

397
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,650
and it is the least of it.

398
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,750
My hope is that it brings us both
much joy over the years.

399
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,450
Eliza.

400
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,850
Eliza.

401
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,350
Stop!

402
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,900
Stop your wailing!

403
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,050
You let yourself be overcome by sorrow.
You will drown in it.

404
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,500
Have you stopped crying for your children?

405
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,000
You make no sounds,
but will you ever let them go in your heart?

406
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,950
...They are as my flesh...
- Then who is distressed?

407
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,400
Do I upset the Master and the Mistress?

408
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,000
Do you care less for my loss
than their well being?

409
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,750
Master Ford is a decent man.
- He is a slaver!

410
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,900
Under the circumstances--
- Under the circumstances he is a slaver!

411
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,700
But you truckle at his boot--
- No.

412
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,650
You luxuriate in his favor.
- I survive!

413
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,700
I will not fall into despair!

414
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,900
I will offer up my talents to Master Ford.

415
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,650
I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune!

416
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,600
- Ford is your opportunity.

417
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Do you think he does not know that
you are more than you suggest?

418
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,300
But he does nothing for you.
Nothing.

419
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,200
You are no better than prized livestock.

420
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,400
Call for him. Call, tell him of your previous
circumstances;

421
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,250
and see what it earns you...Solomon.

422
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:09,200
So, you’ve settled into your role
as Platt, then?

423
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,700
My back is thick with scars from..

424
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,350
protesting my freedom.

425
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:19,200
Do not accuse me..
- I accuse you of nothing.

426
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,350
I cannot accuse.

427
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,350
I have done so many,
many dishonorable things to survive.

428
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,900
And for all of them I have ended up here...

429
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,600
No better than if I had stood up for myself.

430
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,050
God forgive me .

431
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:39,150
Solomon, let me weep for my children.

432
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:52,100
<i>Who so ever yherefore, shall humbles himself ,
as this little child,</i>

433
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,000
<i>the same is greatest in the Kingdom of heaven.</i>

434
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,500
<i>And whoso shall receive...</i>

435
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,200
<i> one such little child in my name
receiveth me.</i>

436
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,950
I cannot have that kind of depression about.

437
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,100
<i>But whoso shall offend one of these little ones
which believe in me, it were better for him</i>

438
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:14,250
<i>that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</i>

439
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:18,750
Amen.
<i>- AMEN !</i>

440
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,350
Make them boards flush.

441
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:36,250
They are, sir.
- No, They is no such thing.

442
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,900
As smooth to the touch as a yearling's coat.

443
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,300
Callin' me a liar, boy?

444
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,550
Only a matter of perspective, sir.

445
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:54,300
From where you stand you may see differently.
But the hands are not mistaken.

446
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,400
I simply ask that you use all your senses
before rendering judgement.

447
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,800
Oh ... my ...You are a brute.

448
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:10,900
You are a dog,
and no better for followin' instruction.

449
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,550
I'll do as ordered, sir.
- Then you'll be up at daybreak.

450
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,550
You will procure
a keg of nails from Chapin;

451
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,650
...and commence puttin' on clapboards.
- Yes, sir .

452
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,900
Make them boards flush.

453
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,400
Where am i going, sir?

454
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,400
Solomon!
Solomon!

455
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,800
Solomon!

456
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,100
Solomon!

457
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:04,700
When I say I had my master's favor,
you understand.

458
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,750
And for nine years
he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life.

459
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,300
Silks and jewels and even...

460
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,900
servants to wait upon us.

461
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:20,450
Such was our life,

462
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:24,750
and the life of this beautiful girl I bore for him.

463
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,500
But Master Berry's daughter...

464
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,100
she always looked at me with an unkind nature.

465
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,400
She hated Emily no matter she and Emily
were flesh of flesh.

466
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,050
As Master Berry's health failed,
she gained power in the household and;

467
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,700
Eventually, I was brought to the city
on the false pretense...

468
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,800
of our free papers being executed.

469
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,200
My poor children .

470
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,550
I thought I told you to commence
puttin' on clapboards.

471
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,600
Yes, master.
I am about it. These have all been replaced.

472
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,950
Didn't I tell yah last night to get a keg of nails?

473
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,400
And so I did;

474
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,650
Goddamn you!
I thought you knowed somethin'!

475
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,300
I did as instructed.

476
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,000
If there's something wrong,
then its wrong with your instructions.

477
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,550
You, black bastard!

478
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,300
You ...

479
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,000
Goddamn ...

480
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,600
black bastard!
Strip yer clothes!

481
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,050
Strip!

482
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,650
I will not!

483
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,500
You ...

484
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,800
Yew will not live..

485
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,900
to see another day, nigger!

486
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,600
God, help!

487
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,800
Monster!

488
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,800
Help! Somebody help me !
Help!

489
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,300
Help! Somebody

490
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,400
Help!

491
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,600
Help me !

492
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,601
What is the matter?

493
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,850
What is the matter?
-Master..

494
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:56,550
Master Tibeats wants to whip me
for using the nails you gave me.

495
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,200
This ain't done by half.

496
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,500
I will have flesh,

497
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,400
and I will have all of it.

498
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,000
Do not stir.

499
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,200
Do not attempt to leave the plantation.
But if you run there is no protecting you.

500
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,900
Stay here .

501
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:24,650
Gentlemen ? Whoever moves that
nigger is adead man .

502
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,600
I am overseer of this plantation,

503
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,750
William Ford holds a mortgage on Platt.

504
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,750
If you hang him, he loses his debt.

505
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,650
You have no claim to his life.

506
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,550
As for you two ...

507
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,650
if you have any regard for your own safety...

508
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:45,750
I say, begone!

509
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:48,000
You got no cause.

510
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,750
Platt is mine, and mine to do
with as I please.

511
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:55,350
If you touch him..

512
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,550
Sam! Get the mule.

513
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,650
Get Master Ford.

514
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,550
I believe Tibeats is skulkin' about the premises somewhere.
He wants you dead,

515
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,450
and he will attempt to have you so.

516
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,950
It's no longer safe for you here.

517
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,900
And I don't believe you will remain
passive if Tibeats attacks.

518
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,100
I have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps.

519
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,200
He will take charge of you.

520
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,450
Master Ford ?

521
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,900
you must know that I am not a slave.

522
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,100
I cannot hear that.
- Before, I came to you I was a freeman.

523
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,400
I am trying to save your life!

524
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,900
And...I have a debt to be mindful of.

525
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,100
That, now, is to Edwin Epps.

526
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,100
He is a hard man.
Prides himself on being a "nigger breaker."

527
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,750
But truthfully, I could find no others
who would have you.

528
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,850
You've made a reputation of yourself.

529
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:06,050
Whatever your circumstances,
you are an exceptional nigger, Platt.

530
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:10,750
I fear no good will come of it.

531
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,500
<i>"And that servant..</i>

532
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,400
<i>which knew his Lord's will...</i>

533
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,500
WHICH KNEW HIS  LORD'S WILL;

534
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,150
<i>and prepared not himself...</i>

535
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:55,350
PREPARED NOT HIMSELF,

536
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:01,750
<i>neither did according to his will,</i>

537
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:07,000
<i>shall be beaten with many stripes...</i>

538
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,200
D'ye hear that?

539
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,700
"Stripes."

540
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,900
That nigger that don't obey his lord -

541
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,750
that's his master - d'ye see?

542
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:22,650
- that 'ere nigger shall be beaten
with many stripes.

543
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:27,250
Now, "many" signifies a great many.

544
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,250
Forty, a hundred,

545
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:33,350
a hundred and fifty lashes...

546
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,300
That's Scripter!

547
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,600
Pick that cotton.

548
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,900
Move along now!

549
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,700
Come on now!

550
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,400
Drive dem niggers.
- Pick that cotton.

551
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,450
Move along now,

552
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,100
hear?

553
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,350
Come on!

554
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,100
Two hundred forty pounds for Bob.

555
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,300
What yah got for James?

556
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,650
Two hundred ninety five pounds.

557
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,350
Tha's real good, boy.
Tha's real good.

558
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:25,950
One hundred eighty two pounds for Platt.

559
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:29,050
How much can even
an average nigger pick a day?

560
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:34,100
Two hundred pounds.
- This nigger ain't even average.

561
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,550
Five hundred twelve pounds for Patsey.

562
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,850
Five hundred twelve.

563
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,700
Yah men folk got no shame
lettin' Patsey out pick yah?

564
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:51,100
The day ain't yet come
she swung lower than five hundred pounds.

565
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,300
Queen of the fields, she is.

566
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,950
138 pounds ...
- I ain't done, Treach.

567
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:03,050
Ain't I owed a minute to luxuriate
on the work Patsey done?

568
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:05,550
Yes, sir .

569
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,400
Damned Queen.

570
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,050
Born and bred to the field.

571
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:19,350
A nigger among niggers,

572
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,400
and God give 'er to me.

573
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,700
A lesson in the rewards of righteous livin'.

574
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,750
All be observant ta that.

575
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:37,350
All!

576
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:40,850
Now, Treach.
Now speak.

577
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:44,450
One hundred thirty eight pounds for Phebe.

578
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:48,400
Hit one forty five yesterday.
Pull her out.

579
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,850
Two hundred six pounds for George.

580
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,550
How much he pick yesterday?

581
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,550
Two twenty nine.
- Not enought.

582
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:00,050
Come on, kid .

583
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:04,750
Come on.
- Come on, boy, move!

584
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,500
Get up ! Tonight we dance !
Get up !

585
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,050
Bring your fiddle, Platt !
Go!

586
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,250
Come on!

587
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:01,350
Come on, Platt!
Come on!

588
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:15,350
Come on! Where's yah merriment?
Move yer feet.

589
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,150
Sell her!
- What's all this?

590
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,900
You will sell the negress!

591
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,900
Sell little Pats?

592
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:39,000
She pick with more vigor
than any other nigger!

593
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,650
Choose another ta go.
- No other.

594
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,500
Sell her!

595
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,000
I will not!

596
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:53,100
You will remove that black bitch from this property,
'er I'll take myself back to Cheneyville.

597
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,200
Back to that hog's trough
where I found you?

598
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:07,250
Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear.

599
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:15,850
'Cause I will rid myself of yah well
before I do away with her!

600
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,500
Whatcha looking at?

601
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,000
That damned woman!

602
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,500
I won't have my mood spoiled.

603
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,700
I will not.

604
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,400
Dance!

605
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,100
Dance, i said!

606
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,700
Come on!

607
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,600
Pick it up, Platt.
Play that thing, boy !

608
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:23,400
Platt?

609
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,100
Yes, Mistress .

610
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:30,100
Can you find your way
to Bartholomew's?

611
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,850
I can, ma'am.

612
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:37,800
This is a list of goods and sundries.
You will take it to be filled and return immediately.

613
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,700
Take your tag.

614
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:44,600
Tell Bartholomew to add it to our debt.
- Yes, Mistress.

615
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:47,950
Where yah from, Platt?

616
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,800
I have told you.
- Tell me again .

617
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,900
Washington .
- Who were yah Master?

618
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,800
Master's name was Freeman .
- Was he a learned man?

619
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:03,950
I suppose so.
- He learn yah ta read?

620
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:06,650
A word here or there,

621
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,800
but I have no understanding of the written text.
- Don't trouble yer self with it.

622
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:15,500
Same as the rest, Master bought yah to work.
Tha's all.

623
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,800
And any more'll earn yah a hun'red lashes.

624
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:27,250
Come here, boy .

625
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,600
Come on.

626
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,750
Where are you going, boy ?
- On my way to...

627
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:53,350
Bartholomew...
Sent by Mistress Epps.

628
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:59,250
You best get to then.

629
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:02,550
Get that quick.

630
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,700
Any trouble?
-No, ma'am.

631
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,300
No trouble.

632
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,650
Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.
- Good morning, Master Shaw.

633
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,350
I've been sent by Master to retrieve Patsey.
May I approach?

634
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,950
You may.

635
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,100
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.

636
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,450
Nigger Platt.
- Patsey, Master wishes you to return.

637
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:17,500
Sabbath day.
I's free ta roam.

638
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,500
But the Master sent me running to fetch you,
and said no time should be wasted.

639
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,400
Do you drink tea?
- Thank you, Mistress, but I don't dare.

640
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:30,400
Would you knowed Massa Epps's consternation
to be any lessened wit your timely return?

641
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,750
Is not it his constant condition?

642
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:37,850
Sit.  Sit and drink the tea that offered.

643
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:45,600
What'n was Epps's concern?

644
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,750
...I'd rather not say...

645
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:50,300
L'il gossip on the Sabbath be fine.

646
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,650
All things in moderation.

647
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:57,600
As you are aware, Master Epps...

648
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:02,200
can be a man of a hard countenance.

649
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,500
You know he has ill feelings toward your husband.

650
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,650
He do.

651
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,800
Master Epps has somehow come to believe,

652
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,500
that Master Shaw is...

653
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,400
is something of a lothario.

654
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:17,100
A misguided belief, no doubt.

655
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:22,700
No doubt...
if not born outta truth itself.

656
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,900
I meant no disrespect.

657
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,950
He ain't heard you.

658
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:31,550
I meant no disrespect to you, Mistress.

659
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,550
Ha! Got no cause to worry for my sensibilities.

660
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:41,300
I ain't felt the end of a lash in
'mo years than I cain recall.

661
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,050
Ain't worked a field, neither.

662
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:49,550
Where one time I served,
now I got others servin' me.

663
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:55,600
The cost to my current
existence be Massa Shaw..

664
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:59,650
broadcasting his affections,
'n me enjoyin' his pantomime of fidelity.

665
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:04,600
If that what keep me from
the cotton pickin' niggers, that what it be.

666
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:09,700
A small and reasonable price to be paid 'fo sure.

667
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:18,850
I knowed what it like to be the object
of Massa's predilections  and peculiarities.

668
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:21,700
A lusty visit in the night,

669
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,600
or a visitation from the whip.

670
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,450
And you take comfort, Patsey;

671
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:29,850
the Good Lord will manage Epps.

672
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:34,850
In His own time the Good Lord will manage dem all.

673
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:42,950
...the curse on the Pharos is a poor example
of all that wait 'fo the plantation class.

674
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,800
This is nice .

675
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:01,800
Patsy?

676
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,600
Patsey!
- Do not look in his direction. Continue on.

677
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,850
Patsey...!
- Found her, Master,

678
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:10,750
and brought her back just as instructed.

679
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,100
What'd you jus now tell her?

680
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,850
What'd you say to Pats?

681
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:20,350
No words were spoken.
None of consequence.

682
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:25,000
Lie!  Damned liar!

683
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,150
Saw you talkin' with 'er.

684
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,750
Tell me!

685
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,500
I cannot speak of what did not occur.

686
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,000
I'll cut your black throat.
- Master...

687
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,200
You come here!
- Master, i brought her back...

688
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,750
I said come here!
- I brought her back, just like you ...

689
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:46,400
Come here!
- Come on, let's go!

690
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,100
I got her, just as instructed.

691
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,150
Stay away from Patsy, boy !

692
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:34,200
It's the Lord's day .

693
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:38,500
Ain't nothin' Christian in us carryin' on like this.

694
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:47,150
I concede to yah,

695
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:51,050
but in the name of valor,

696
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:54,650
help yer master to his feet.

697
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,150
Wha's the fuss?

698
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:03,850
Master Epps believed Patsey and me
to be in conversation when we were not.

699
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:05,400
I tried to explain, but it lead to all this.

700
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,951
What is it?  Ya cain't remain the Sabbath
without her under your eye?

701
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,350
Hold on...
- Ya are a no-account bastard.

702
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,550
A filthy, godless heathen.

703
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,350
My bed is too holy for yah ta share.

704
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:18,750
wha's he been tellin' yah?
- Of yer misbegotten ways.

705
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:22,200
And he would know what of anythin'?

706
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,950
I ain't even spoken with him today.

707
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,350
yah lyin' nigger, Platt.

708
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:30,450
Have I?

709
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,400
Have I?

710
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,050
There; there's all the truth he got.

711
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:41,150
Damned nigger.

712
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,200
Patsy ?

713
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:33,600
A moment from the dancing.

714
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,800
Come sample what I baked for y'all.

715
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:37,550
Thank you , mistress .
- Thank you , mistress .

716
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:39,250
Thank you, Mistress !
- Thank you, Mistress !

717
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:42,850
Thank you, mistress .
- There'll be none for you, Patsey.

718
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,400
Yah see that?

719
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,000
Did yah see the
look of insolence she give me?

720
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:52,950
Seen nothin' but her turn away.
- Are you blind or ignorant?

721
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:55,350
It was hot, hateful scorn.

722
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:58,100
It filled that black face.

723
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,550
Yah tell me yah did'n see it, then yah choose not to look,

724
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,650
or yah sayin' I lie.

725
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:06,550
Whatever it was, it passed.

726
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:10,000
Is that how yah are with the niggers?

727
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,850
Let every ill thought fester inside 'em.

728
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:15,500
Look at them .

729
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,800
They foul with it;

730
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,450
They foul with their hate.

731
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:24,850
You let it be,
it'll come back to us in the dark a night.

732
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,000
Yah want that?

733
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:33,000
Yah want them black animals to leave us
gut like pigs in our own sleep?

734
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,750
No...

735
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:38,200
You are manless.

736
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,500
A damned eunuch if ever there was.

737
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,350
And if yah won't stand for me,
I'd pray you'd at least be a credit to yer own kind..

738
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:50,000
and beat every foul thought from 'em.

739
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,500
Beat it from 'em!

740
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,250
Eat !

741
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:20,600
Fill yourselves.

742
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,700
...And
then we dance.

743
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,400
I said, eat!

744
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,550
Platt...

745
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:51,450
Platt, you awake?

746
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,600
I am.

747
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:57,600
I have a request .

748
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,500
an act of kindness.

749
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,150
I secreted it from the Mistress.

750
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:10,650
Return it!
- It yours, Platt.

751
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,000
For what cause?

752
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,700
All I ask:

753
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,450
end my life.

754
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:21,900
Take my body to the margin of the swamp--

755
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Take me by the throat.
Hold me low in the water...

756
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:28,200
until I's still 'n without life.

757
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:33,200
Bury me in a lonely place of dyin'.
- I will do no such thing.

758
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:38,900
The...the gory detail with which you speak--
- I thought on it long and hard.

759
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,600
It is melancholia,

760
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,250
... nothing more.

761
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:47,250
How can you fall into such despair?

762
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:50,850
How can you not know?

763
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:57,600
I got no comfort in this life.

764
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:05,050
If I cain't buy mercy from yah,
I'll beg it.

765
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:07,850
There are others.

766
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:11,000
Beg them.
- I'm begging you!<i> - <font color=#1191CE>Why ?</font></i>

767
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:15,100
Why would you consign me to damnation
with such an un-Godly request?

768
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:17,850
- There is God here!

769
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:21,450
God is merciful...

770
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,550
...and He forgive merciful acts.

771
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:27,850
Won't be no hell for you.

772
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:31,150
Do it .

773
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,000
Do what I ain't got the strength ta do myself.

774
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:20,600
It is a plague.

775
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:25,900
Cotton worm.
- A plague!  It's damn Biblical.

776
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,500
Two season God done sent a plague to smite me.

777
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:35,450
What I done that God hate me so?

778
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,800
It's that Godless lot.

779
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:45,750
They brought this on me.

780
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:52,850
I bring 'em God's word,
and heathens they are, they brung me God's scorn.

781
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,050
Damn you!

782
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:59,400
Damn you !

783
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:02,300
Damn all, you'all !

784
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:32,250
Judge?
- Mr. Epps .

785
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,750
I am deeply sadden to hear
about your misfortune.

786
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:43,400
Listen up.

787
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,750
Yer Judge Turner's for the season.
More if need be,

788
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,950
... until my crop return.

789
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:50,500
Yah'll bring no disrespect to me,

790
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,600
and yah'll bring no biblical plagues to him.
You hear?

791
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,550
Or I'll  take all your skin.

792
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:59,850
Get out.

793
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:54,050
Get off the porch!??
Get off the porch !

794
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,900
Platt is it?

795
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,500
Yes , sir .
- Have you cultivated cane previously?

796
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:10,250
No, sir. I am not.
- You take to it quite naturally.

797
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:12,250
Are you educated?
- No, sir .

798
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:16,100
Niggers are hired to work,
not to read and write.

799
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:20,100
You play the fiddle?
- Yes , sir .

800
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,250
Yes, I do.

801
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:28,350
Willard Yarney, a planter up the bayou,
celebrates his anniversary in a three week's time.

802
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:30,800
I will hold out your name to him.

803
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,900
What you earn is yours to keep.

804
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:35,700
Yes, sir .

805
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,000
Mind yourself, Platt.

806
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:56,450
Woooo!

807
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:03,500
Joyous day it is ?

808
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,100
Joyous day?

809
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,600
Dark times is behind us.

810
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:13,200
Clean livin' 'n prayer
done lifted the plague.

811
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:18,650
As thick 'n white as New England snow.

812
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,600
'N now my niggers is returned to me.

813
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:29,050
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.

814
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,800
Oh, did you beguile him, Platt,

815
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:37,900
with your slick nigger ways?

816
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,950
Well, yah won't stand idle, boy.

817
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:45,850
Not on my land.

818
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,800
Much work to do.

819
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,750
Days of old long since, eh?

820
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:56,500
huh?

821
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,765
Joyous!  Joyous indeed!

822
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:11,050
Let's go find something sweet for you. Hmm?

823
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,200
Candy.
- Candy?

824
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:46,300
George?
- 180 pounds.

825
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:50,300
Patsey ?
- Five hundred twenty pounds for Patsey.

826
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,500
Tha's my girl.
Don't never let me down.

827
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:58,100
Platt?
- One hundred sixty pounds.

828
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,950
Armsby?

829
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:04,050
Sixty four pounds.

830
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:10,050
A good days labor would average two hundred pounds.

831
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,100
Yes, sir .

832
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,100
I'm sure in time y'll develope as a picker,

833
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,200
but it takes effort, boy.

834
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:25,600
Put some damn effort into it.
- Yes , sir .

835
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:29,450
Take 'em out.
Get to whippin'.

836
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:37,450
It's a tragedy.

837
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:40,200
How does such come to pass?

838
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:44,000
Working a field and picking cotton like a lowly hand.

839
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,350
I'm of a damn sight better station.

840
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:49,500
I've worked as an overseer, you know.

841
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,300
I did not know, sir.
- Not "sir."

842
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,150
Just Armsby.

843
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:58,450
Not owed more than any other in the field.

844
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,750
How did you get in that position ,
if I may ask?

845
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:05,850
Ask.  It's just conversation.

846
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:09,750
I became a little too dependant on the whisky,

847
01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:13,050
a little too undependable on the job.

848
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,250
Before you say I'm just a sorry drunkard,

849
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:18,850
... let me state my case:

850
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,600
As reliable employment as overseeing is,

851
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:24,550
... it's no easy chore on the spirit.

852
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:27,550
I say no man of conscious;

853
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:33,419
can take the lash to another human day in,
and day out without shredding at his own self.

854
01:30:33,619 --> 01:30:35,900
Takes him to a place...

855
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,850
where he either makes excuses
within his mind to be unaffected...

856
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:45,100
Or finds some way to trample his guilty sensations.

857
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,900
Well, I trampled.

858
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
And with frequency.

859
01:30:50,350 --> 01:30:56,650
I gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity;

860
01:30:56,750 --> 01:31:01,650
But such profitable outcomes are reserved
for the plantation masters.

861
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:05,950
It's the lot of the rest of us to serve.

862
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:09,755
Now, I want nothing more
than to earn a decent wage..

863
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:13,050
And get myself home.

864
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:47,050
The proceeds of my fiddling performances.

865
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:49,400
A few picayunes,

866
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,700
but all I have in the world.

867
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:55,400
I promise them to you
if you will do me the favor I require.

868
01:31:55,500 --> 01:32:00,500
But I beg you not to expose me
if you cannot grant the request.

869
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,450
What..

870
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:06,450
what is it that you ask?
- First, your word, sir.

871
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:09,050
On my honor.

872
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:12,550
It is a simple enough request.

873
01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:16,850
I only that you deposit a letter
in the post office in Marksville.

874
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:21,900
And that you keep the action
an inviolable secret forever.

875
01:32:23,650 --> 01:32:27,850
A patron is what I require, sir.

876
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,300
I'll do it .

877
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,000
And will accept whatever payment is offered.

878
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:42,850
To assist you, I put my own self at risk.

879
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:44,900
I will do so,

880
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,100
but fair compensation is all I ask.

881
01:32:57,650 --> 01:32:59,650
Draw up your letter.

882
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:03,800
We will meet again.
In two days?

883
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:06,400
In two days.

884
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,500
...Thank you.

885
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,400
Well, boy.

886
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:32,450
I understand I've got a learned nigger

887
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:35,300
that writes letters..

888
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:39,000
and tries to get white fellows to mail 'em.

889
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:47,500
Well, Armsby tol' me today...

890
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:51,100
the devil was among my niggers.

891
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:54,850
That I had one that needed close watchin'

892
01:34:54,950 --> 01:34:57,750
or he would run away.

893
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:01,900
When I asked him , "Why ?" ...

894
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,400
he said you come over to him...

895
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:08,450
and waked him up in the middle of the night,

896
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:12,300
and wanted him to carry a letter...

897
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:16,300
... to Marksville.

898
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,900
What have yah got to say to that?

899
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:28,200
There is no truth in it .

900
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,800
You say.

901
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:34,850
How could I write a letter without ink or paper?

902
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:39,450
Who am i going to write a letter.
There is no friends living as I know of.

903
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:42,950
That Armsby...

904
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:47,850
That Armsby is a lying drunken fellow.

905
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:52,500
Didn't he want you to hire him for an overseer?

906
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:56,100
That's it.

907
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,250
He wants to make you believe
we're all going to run away..

908
01:35:58,350 --> 01:36:02,250
and so, you'll hire an overseer to watch us.

909
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:05,500
He believes you are soft soap.

910
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,900
He's given to such talk.

911
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,200
made this story a lie, out of whole cloth,

912
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:16,800
'cause he wants to get a situation.

913
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,500
It's all a lie, master,

914
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:31,900
It's all a lie.

915
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:42,050
I'll be damned .

916
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:51,950
Were he not free and white, Platt.

917
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:55,850
Were he not free and white.

918
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:28,300
Edward?
Give him water !

919
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,500
I just want to say something ...

920
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:17,600
'bout Uncle Abram .

921
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:22,800
He was a good man..

922
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:26,400
...and always looked out for us ,
ever since we were little.

923
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,900
God loved him .

924
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,500
God has blessed
God keep him.

925
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:35,200
Amen .

926
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:02,600
Wait till the end.

927
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,550
Hey, Bass?

928
01:42:12,650 --> 01:42:14,100
No, no, no ...

929
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,850
No shame in taking respite from the heat;

930
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:18,650
drink, shade.

931
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:22,850
It's ungodly for travelers.
Hearty, or otherwise.

932
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:29,800
What's funny ?
- Epps, I'm here to complete the work at hand.

933
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:33,200
As requested
and as paid for.

934
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:35,400
Something rubs you wrongly.

935
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,200
I offer you the opportunity to speak off.

936
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,569
Well you ask plainly, 
so I well tell you plainly.

937
01:42:45,246 --> 01:42:47,275
What amused me just then, was..

938
01:42:47,401 --> 01:42:49,670
..your concern for my
well being in this heat.

939
01:42:49,896 --> 01:42:51,238
When quite frankly..

940
01:42:51,364 --> 01:42:52,747
..the conditions of your labours..

941
01:42:52,773 --> 01:42:54,599
- the condition of my labour?
- It is hard!

942
01:42:54,625 --> 01:42:57,825
- What the hell?
- It's all wrong..all wrong, mr Epps.

943
01:42:57,826 --> 01:42:59,642
They ain't hired help.

944
01:43:00,268 --> 01:43:01,309
 There my property.

945
01:43:02,035 --> 01:43:04,870
- You say that with pride.
- I say it as fact.

946
01:43:07,196 --> 01:43:10,205
This conversation concerns
what is fact and what's not.

947
01:43:10,631 --> 01:43:12,566
Then it must be said.

948
01:43:12,592 --> 01:43:15,801
That there is no justice, 
or righteous in this slavery.

949
01:43:16,727 --> 01:43:18,909
But you do open up a interesting question..

950
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:21,643
What right have you too your niggers?..

951
01:43:21,769 --> 01:43:24,221
..when you come down to the point?
- What right?

952
01:43:25,347 --> 01:43:27,972
I bought them, I paid for them.

953
01:43:28,698 --> 01:43:31,949
Of course you did, and the.. law say's
you have the right to hold a nigger.

954
01:43:32,075 --> 01:43:34,413
But begging the laws pardon, It lies.

955
01:43:34,839 --> 01:43:37,450
Suppose they patch the law,
 take away your liberty.

956
01:43:37,676 --> 01:43:39,101
Making you a slave.

957
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:42,150
Suppose.
- That ain't a supposable case.

958
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:45,900
Laws change, Epps.
Universal truths are constant.

959
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,450
It is a fact,

960
01:43:47,550 --> 01:43:50,400
a plain and simle fact that what is true and right..

961
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:55,500
is true and right for all.
White and black alike.

962
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:58,300
Yah compare me to a nigger, Bass?

963
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:02,400
I only ask, in the eye's of God..
What's the difference ?

964
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:07,700
Yah might as well ask what the difference
is between a white man and a baboon.

965
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,300
Now, I seen one of them critters in Orleans..

966
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:14,050
that knowed just as much as any nigger I got.

967
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:17,600
Listen, Eps ...
These niggers are human beings.

968
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:20,100
If they are allowed to scale no higher than brute animals,

969
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:23,700
you and men like you will have to answer for it.

970
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:26,000
There's an ill, Mr. Epps .

971
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:29,250
A fearful ill, resting on this nation--

972
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:32,850
There will be a day of reckoning yet.

973
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:37,700
You like to hear yourself talk, Bass,

974
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,750
better than any man I know of.

975
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:44,650
Yah'd argue that black was white, or white black

976
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:47,950
if anybody would contradict you.

977
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:52,350
A fine supposition if yah lived
among Yankees in New England.

978
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:55,250
But yah don't.

979
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,800
You most assuredly do not.

980
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:28,300
I know it's somewhere in there !

981
01:45:30,150 --> 01:45:33,150
Patsey!

982
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,550
Pats!

983
01:45:35,650 --> 01:45:37,650
Where is she ?

984
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:39,200
Where the Pats ?

985
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,950
Where is she? Where the Pats'?
Whatcha just standing there?

986
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:49,950
We know nothin' of her, Massa.
- The hell you don't!

987
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,800
We do not know anything about ...
- About what?

988
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:53,350
Where did she go?
- I do not know .

989
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:54,700
She run off, ain't she?
- I do not know anything .

990
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:56,400
She ran off!
Where is it?

991
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,350
You know it! You know it! You know it!
- No, no, no ...

992
01:46:01,450 --> 01:46:04,450
No i don't.

993
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:10,850
you miserable black dogs stand like
the deef and dumb.

994
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:14,450
Speak!

995
01:46:28,450 --> 01:46:30,650
She gone...

996
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:35,300
My Pats gone.

997
01:46:51,350 --> 01:46:53,400
Run off.  Run off, did you?

998
01:46:53,450 --> 01:46:55,400
Massa Epps--
- You miserable wench!  Where you been?

999
01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:58,050
I been nowhere.
- Lies to your misdeeds!

1000
01:46:58,150 --> 01:47:01,000
The Sabbath day, Massa.
I took me a walk to commune wit da Lord.

1001
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:04,500
Bring the Lord into yer deceptions?
Comin' from Shaw's plantation weren't yah?

1002
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:06,800
...No...
- Now yah speak?

1003
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:09,050
Now that yah want to add to
'er lies yah find yer tongue!

1004
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:11,900
I went to Massa Shaw's plantation!

1005
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,650
You admit it ?
- Yes .

1006
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:16,650
Freely.  And you know why.

1007
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:19,900
I got this from Mistress Shaw.

1008
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,400
Mistress Epps won't even grant me
no soap ta clean with.

1009
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:29,000
Stink so much I make myself gag.

1010
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:36,700
Five hundred pounds 'a cotton
day in, day out!

1011
01:47:36,850 --> 01:47:38,800
More than any man here.

1012
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:41,000
And 'fo that I will be clean;

1013
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:42,750
that all I ask.

1014
01:47:42,850 --> 01:47:47,300
Dis here what I went to Shaw's 'fo.

1015
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:52,500
Liar! Liar!
- Lord knows it all !

1016
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:57,750
You lie!
- And you blind wit yer own covetousness.

1017
01:47:57,850 --> 01:48:00,350
I don't lie, Massa.

1018
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:04,200
If you kill me, I'll stick ta that.

1019
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:06,700
Yeah, I'll set you down.

1020
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:09,100
I'll learn you to go to Shaw's.

1021
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:11,400
Treach!

1022
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:14,000
Go fetch some line.

1023
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:16,300
Edward?

1024
01:48:16,850 --> 01:48:20,850
Strip her.
Strike her bare 'n lash her to the post.

1025
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:25,300
No!

1026
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:41,350
Yah done this to yerself, Pats!

1027
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:54,300
Do it !

1028
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:01,400
Strike the life from her.

1029
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,000
Beat her.

1030
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:12,550
Give her the whip.
Give it all to her!

1031
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:16,850
Plat , come here
and play it immediately !

1032
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,900
Platt!

1033
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:25,100
Come here!

1034
01:49:25,650 --> 01:49:28,650
PATSEY: I'd rather it you, Platt.

1035
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:30,950
Strike her.

1036
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:34,400
Strike her.

1037
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:57,600
He pantomimes.

1038
01:49:57,700 --> 01:50:00,200
There ain't barely a welt on her.

1039
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:02,750
That's what your niggers make of yah;

1040
01:50:02,850 --> 01:50:05,650
a fool fer the takin'.

1041
01:50:09,450 --> 01:50:11,950
Strike her, Platt!
Strike her.

1042
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:32,400
Yah will strike her.
Yah will strike her until her flesh is rent..

1043
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:36,600
and meat and blood flow equal,
or I will kill every nigger in my sight!

1044
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:39,450
Do you understand me ?
Strike her!

1045
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:42,550
Strike her!

1046
01:51:24,450 --> 01:51:28,250
Until I say no more!
I ain't said nothing!

1047
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:35,450
Give me the whip !

1048
01:51:35,550 --> 01:51:37,150
Give it!

1049
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:39,350
Give me the whip !

1050
01:51:39,450 --> 01:51:41,450
Get up!

1051
01:52:00,050 --> 01:52:02,850
You're the devil!

1052
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,400
Sooner or later...

1053
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:14,000
somewhere in the course of eternal justice
thou shalt answer for this sin!

1054
01:52:17,150 --> 01:52:21,150
Sin? There is no sin.

1055
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:25,600
A man does how he pleases with his property.

1056
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:34,050
At the moment, Platt, I am of great pleasure.

1057
01:52:34,150 --> 01:52:39,150
You be goddamn careful
I don't come to wantin' to lightenin' my mood no further.

1058
01:54:56,050 --> 01:54:58,200
Master Bass,

1059
01:54:58,300 --> 01:55:02,100
I want to ask you
what part of the country you came from?

1060
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:04,900
No part of this land.

1061
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:08,300
I was born in Canada.

1062
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,250
Now guess where that is.

1063
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:13,100
Oh, I know where Canada is.

1064
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:16,400
I have been there myself.

1065
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,750
Montreal and

1066
01:55:21,850 --> 01:55:24,600
Kingston and Queenston
and a great many places.

1067
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:26,900
Well traveled for a slave.

1068
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,500
How came you here?

1069
01:55:30,150 --> 01:55:33,150
Master Bass,

1070
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:38,000
if justice had been done
I never would have been here.

1071
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:44,650
How's this?

1072
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:47,250
Tell me all.

1073
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:54,000
I am afraid to tell you.

1074
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:58,400
Every word you speak is a profound secret.

1075
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:08,000
Your story ...

1076
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:12,300
...it is amazing, and in no good way.

1077
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:18,150
Do you believe , sir ...

1078
01:56:18,250 --> 01:56:21,100
..in justice as you have said?

1079
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:22,538
Yes , I do.

1080
01:56:22,738 --> 01:56:26,490
- That slavery is an evil that should befall none?

1081
01:56:29,450 --> 01:56:34,450
I believe so .
- If you truly do,

1082
01:56:35,050 --> 01:56:37,200
Then, I would ask...

1083
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:39,800
I would beg...

1084
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:44,050
that you write my friends in the north,

1085
01:56:44,150 --> 01:56:48,150
acquainting them with my situation..

1086
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:50,900
and beseeching them to forward;

1087
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,800
free papers.

1088
01:56:57,400 --> 01:57:01,200
It would be...

1089
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:06,350
an unspeakable happiness;

1090
01:57:06,550 --> 01:57:09,750
To see my wife

1091
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:15,150
and my family again.

1092
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:23,500
I've been traveling this country for
the best part of twenty years.

1093
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:26,500
My freedom is everything.

1094
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:32,100
The fact that I can walk out of here tomorrow
gives me most pleasure.

1095
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:36,500
My life doesn't mean much to anyone,

1096
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:41,450
but it seems your life means a lot to a lot of people.

1097
01:57:42,450 --> 01:57:44,350
About what you're asking me..

1098
01:57:44,450 --> 01:57:47,950
Sir, scares me.

1099
01:57:49,150 --> 01:57:52,950
I must say, I am afraid.

1100
01:57:53,050 --> 01:57:56,850
Not just for you, but for me.

1101
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:07,200
I will write your letter sir,

1102
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:09,650
for if I could bring freedom,
it will be more than a pleasure.

1103
01:58:09,700 --> 01:58:11,850
...it will be my duty.

1104
01:58:11,950 --> 01:58:16,950
Now, would you be so kindly
hand me those sickles?

1105
02:00:49,850 --> 02:00:54,650
Platt...? Where is the boy called Platt?

1106
02:00:56,850 --> 02:00:59,650
Come here, boy .

1107
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:23,500
Your name is Platt, is it?

1108
02:01:23,850 --> 02:01:25,750
Yes, sir.

1109
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:29,050
Do you know that man?

1110
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:47,300
Mr. Parker... ?

1111
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,600
Say again?

1112
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:53,200
Mr. Parker?

1113
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:55,950
That man received a letter
compiling many accusations.

1114
02:01:56,050 --> 02:01:58,400
You look me in the eye...

1115
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,150
and on your life answer me truthfully:

1116
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,000
have you any other name than Platt?

1117
02:02:02,050 --> 02:02:05,500
Solomon Northup is my name.
- Sheriff...What's all this?

1118
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:08,350
It's official business.
- My nigga 's my job .

1119
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:10,300
Your business waits.

1120
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:12,550
Tell me of your family.
- I have a wife and two children.

1121
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:14,800
... two. - What the hell ?
- What were your children's names?

1122
02:02:14,850 --> 02:02:17,150
Margaret and Alonzo.
- And your wife's name before her marriage?

1123
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:19,250
Anne Hampton.
I am who I say.

1124
02:02:19,350 --> 02:02:20,900
Where are you going, Platt ?

1125
02:02:20,950 --> 02:02:22,950
Who authorized you to roam
on my property? - My mistake .

1126
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:26,500
Platt, come back here!
Platt!

1127
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:29,100
Come back here, boy !

1128
02:02:32,250 --> 02:02:34,550
Nah...  You will unhand 'em.
Platt is my nigger!

1129
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:37,300
He is Mr. Solomon Nortap !
- You say...

1130
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:39,950
You come here, humiliate me
and make claims.

1131
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,650
I have no doubts.
This is Solomon Northup,

1132
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:44,050
To hell with that!  My nigger,
and I'll fight you for 'em!

1133
02:02:44,150 --> 02:02:45,450
As is your right.

1134
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,900
As it will be my pleasure
to bankrupt you in the courts.

1135
02:02:47,950 --> 02:02:50,750
Your decision.
Unhand him !

1136
02:02:51,250 --> 02:02:53,200
You think this is the last you'll see of me, boy?

1137
02:02:53,250 --> 02:02:55,400
It ain't.

1138
02:02:55,450 --> 02:02:58,550
I paid fairly for this nigga !
The court has the documents to prove it!

1139
02:02:58,650 --> 02:03:00,500
And we have the documents also
proving that it is free !

1140
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:02,450
I own you !
You belong to me ! Can you hear me ?

1141
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:06,100
Keep your hands off him !
- The court will take you back before sundown!

1142
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:10,200
Platt!
- Get my horse, please.

1143
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:21,400
Get away from him, Pats' !

1144
02:03:21,450 --> 02:03:25,650
I'll be seeing you real soon.

1145
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:30,700
Solomon?

1146
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:09,500
I apologize...

1147
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:13,700
 for my appearance.

1148
02:05:15,250 --> 02:05:18,050
