1
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:55,505
<i>Remember, remember
The 5th of November</i>

2
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:58,236
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

3
00:00:58,396 --> 00:01:00,591
<i>I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason</i>

4
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,587
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

5
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:07,354
<i>But what of the man?</i>

6
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:10,906
<i>I know his name was Guy Fawkes...</i>

7
00:01:11,076 --> 00:01:15,627
<i>...and I know in 1605, he attempted
to blow up the Houses of Parliament.</i>

8
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:17,912
<i>But who was he really?</i>

9
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:19,475
<i>What was he like?</i>

10
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:29,352
<i>We are told to remember the idea
and not the man.</i>

11
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:31,029
<i>Because a man can fail.</i>

12
00:01:32,116 --> 00:01:35,995
<i>He can be caught,
he can be killed and forgotten.</i>

13
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:38,112
<i>But 400 years later...</i>

14
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:40,915
<i>...an idea can still change the world.</i>

15
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:45,706
<i>I have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas.</i>

16
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:48,192
<i>I've seen people kill
in the name of them...</i>

17
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:51,594
<i>...and die defending them.</i>

18
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:55,671
<i>But you cannot kiss an idea...</i>

19
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:58,909
<i>...cannot touch it or hold it.</i>

20
00:01:59,956 --> 00:02:03,505
<i>Ideas do not bleed.
They do not feel pain.</i>

21
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:05,667
<i>They do not love.</i>

22
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:10,836
<i>And it is not an idea that I miss.</i>

23
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:12,873
<i>It is a man.</i>

24
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:16,426
<i>A man that made me remember
the 5th of November.</i>

25
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,587
<i>A man that I will never forget.</i>

26
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:36,269
<i>So I read that the former United States
is so desperate for medical supplies...</i>

27
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:41,271
<i>...that they have allegedly sent several
containers filled with wheat and tobacco.</i>

28
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:44,712
<i>A gesture, they said, of goodwill.</i>

29
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:46,668
<i>You wanna know what I think?</i>

30
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:50,309
<i>Well, you're listening to my show,
so I will assume you do.</i>

31
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:53,707
<i>It's high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them.</i>

32
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:57,949
<i>I think it's payback time for a tea party
they threw us a few hundred years ago.</i>

33
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:01,188
<i>I say we go down to those docks tonight
and dump that crap...</i>

34
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:04,507
<i>...where everything from the
Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica belongs!</i>

35
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:06,985
<i>Who's with me? Who's bloody with me?!</i>

36
00:03:08,236 --> 00:03:09,635
<i>Did you like that?</i>

37
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:13,789
<i>U.S.A., Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica.
I mean, what else can you say?</i>

38
00:03:13,956 --> 00:03:17,392
<i>Here was a country that had everything,
absolutely everything...</i>

39
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:19,786
<i>...and now, 20 years later, is what?</i>

40
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:23,471
<i>The world's biggest leper colony. Why?</i>

41
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:25,630
<i>Godlessness.</i>

42
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,354
<i>Let me say that again.</i>

43
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:28,744
<i>Godlessness.</i>

44
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:32,312
<i>It wasn't the war they started.
It wasn't the plague they created.</i>

45
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:34,627
<i>It was Judgment.</i>

46
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:38,755
<i>No one escapes their past.
No one escapes Judgment.</i>

47
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:42,033
<i>You think he's not up there?</i>

48
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:44,585
<i>You think he's not watching over
this country?</i>

49
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:48,795
<i>How else can you explain it?
He tested us, but we came through.</i>

50
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:50,309
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

51
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:54,390
<i>Islington. Enfield.
I was there. I saw it all.</i>

52
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:56,831
<i>Immigrants, Muslims...</i>

53
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:59,624
<i>...homosexuals, terrorists.</i>

54
00:03:59,796 --> 00:04:03,550
<i>Disease-ridden degenerates.
They had to go.</i>

55
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:06,753
<i>Strength through unity.
Unity through faith.</i>

56
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:10,704
<i>I am a God-fearing Englishman,
and I'm goddamn proud of it!</i>

57
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,151
That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.

58
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,434
Oh, shit.

59
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:22,072
<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

60
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:25,433
<i>Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.</i>

61
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:27,985
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

62
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:31,307
<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

63
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:34,786
<i>Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.</i>

64
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:36,309
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

65
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:40,274
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, I didn't see you...

66
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:42,028
- In a hurry, are we?
- I was just...

67
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:44,790
- It's past curfew, you know.
- My uncle, he's very sick.

68
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:48,392
- Sick uncle? What you think, Willy?
- It's a load of bollocks.

69
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:51,354
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.

70
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:54,713
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.

71
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:56,946
See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?

72
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:59,835
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.

73
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:03,511
- Don't touch me!
- Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.

74
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:06,349
- She just threatened us.
- That she did, that she did.

75
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:08,029
You know what that means,
don't you?

76
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:10,835
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.

77
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:12,788
And you get to swallow it.

78
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:14,992
- You're Fingermen.
- She's getting the picture.

79
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:16,794
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

80
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:18,867
Not yet you're not. But you will be.

81
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:22,426
By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...

82
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,907
...then you'll certainly be the sorest.

83
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:30,387
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.

84
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:32,945
I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!

85
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:36,233
- What do you think, lads?
- Spare the rod, spoil the child.

86
00:05:36,396 --> 00:05:37,909
Help me! Someone help!

87
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:41,273
The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him.

88
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:44,353
- What the hell?!
- Bugger off!

89
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:46,507
Disdaining fortune,
with his brandish'd steel...

90
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:48,473
...which smoked with bloody execution.

91
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:50,069
We're Fingermen, pal.

92
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:25,435
Jesus Christ! Mercy!

93
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:27,666
We are oft to blame in this...
'Tis too much proved.

94
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:29,827
- that with devotion's visage
and pious action...

95
00:06:29,996 --> 00:06:31,554
...we do sugar o'er the devil himself.

96
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:34,230
- What's that mean?
- Spare the rod.

97
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:41,594
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

98
00:06:41,756 --> 00:06:43,348
- Who are you?
- Who?

99
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:45,871
Who is but the form
following the function of what...

100
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:47,788
...and what I am is a man in a mask.

101
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:49,912
- Oh, I can see that.
- Of course you can.

102
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,146
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.

103
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:56,229
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

104
00:06:57,756 --> 00:07:00,828
- Right.
- But on this most auspicious of nights...

105
00:07:00,996 --> 00:07:04,147
...permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet...

106
00:07:04,316 --> 00:07:07,353
...to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona.

107
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:09,989
Voil?

108
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:12,067
In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran...

109
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:16,229
...cast vicariously as both victim
and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.

110
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:18,990
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity...

111
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:22,512
...is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.

112
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:26,874
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified...

113
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:30,585
...and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice...

114
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:34,385
...and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.

115
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:43,308
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta...

116
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:47,025
...held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such...

117
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:50,347
...shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.

118
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:56,593
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.

119
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:59,554
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you...

120
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,354
...and you may call me V.

121
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,427
Are you, like, a crazy person?

122
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:07,552
I am quite sure they will say so.

123
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:09,593
But to whom, might I ask,
am I speaking?

124
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:13,472
- I'm Evey.
- Evey?

125
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:15,911
E-vey. Of course you are.

126
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:18,666
- What does that mean?
- It means that I, like God...

127
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:21,908
...do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.

128
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:23,828
Are you hurt?

129
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:25,588
No, I'm fine.

130
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:29,308
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, I merely played my part.

131
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:33,025
- But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
- I suppose.

132
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,152
You see, I'm a musician of sorts...

133
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:37,591
...and on my way to give
a very special performance.

134
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:39,269
What kind of musician?

135
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,233
Percussion instruments
are my speciality.

136
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,593
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event...

137
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,712
...and would be honored
if you could join me.

138
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,912
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.

139
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:51,510
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.

140
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:54,349
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.

141
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,625
All right.

142
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:00,915
It's beautiful up here.

143
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:05,275
A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.

144
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:06,869
I don't see any instruments.

145
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:09,834
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.

146
00:09:10,556 --> 00:09:15,027
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto...

147
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:18,347
...in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts...

148
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,395
...and in recognition of the imposter
that stands in her stead.

149
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,630
Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?

150
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,988
- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.

151
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:39,026
<i>Remember, remember
The 5th of November</i>

152
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:42,154
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

153
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:45,149
<i>I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason</i>

154
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:47,750
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

155
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:54,195
First, the overture.

156
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:57,107
Yes.

157
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,468
Yes, the strings.

158
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:02,948
Listen carefully, can you hear it?

159
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:06,072
Now the brass.

160
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:07,908
I can hear it!

161
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:16,633
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!

162
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:23,186
- How do you do that?
- Wait.

163
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,187
Here comes the crescendo!

164
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:34,866
How beautiful, is it not?

165
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:50,069
<i>Gentlemen, you have had four hours.
You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.</i>

166
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:53,028
The Bailey area is quarantined.

167
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,346
All significant witnesses
have been detained.

168
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:56,665
<i>Good. Mr. Etheridge?</i>

169
00:10:56,836 --> 00:11:00,715
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

170
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:03,515
<i>The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
1812 Overture.</i>

171
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:06,031
<i>Add it to the blacklist.
I never want to hear that again.</i>

172
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:07,345
Yes, sir.

173
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:11,111
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance...

174
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:14,712
...indicating a high percentage
of conversation about the explosion.

175
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:16,753
<i>Mr. Dascomb,
what are we doing about that?</i>

176
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,191
We're calling it an emergency demolition.

177
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:22,268
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.

178
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:26,475
Experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.

179
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:29,469
<i>I want Prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings...</i>

180
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:32,946
<i>...and how we must avoid clinging
to the edifice of a decadent past.</i>

181
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:36,631
<i>He should conclude that the New Bailey
will become the symbol of our time...</i>

182
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,833
<i>...and the future
that our conviction has rewarded us.</i>

183
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:41,145
<i>Mr. Heyer.</i>

184
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:44,388
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist...

185
00:11:44,556 --> 00:11:47,787
...though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

186
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:52,905
We also managed to get a picture of
the girl that Creedy's men were detaining.

187
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:55,271
<i>- Who is she, Mr. Finch?
- Not sure yet, sir.</i>

188
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:57,870
<i>- But we're working on several leads.
- Anything else?</i>

189
00:11:58,076 --> 00:11:59,748
We located the fireworks launch...

190
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,669
...and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

191
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:07,864
Unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication...

192
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:11,585
...these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals...

193
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:14,145
...making them very difficult to trace.

194
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:17,995
Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.

195
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,393
<i>Spare us your professional annotations,
Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.</i>

196
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:23,194
Apologies, chancellor.

197
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:24,948
<i>Gentlemen, this is a test.</i>

198
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:27,630
<i>Moments such as these
are matters of faith.</i>

199
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:30,868
<i>To fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe...</i>

200
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:32,628
<i>...everything we have fought for.</i>

201
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:37,551
<i>Doubt will plunge this country back
into chaos, and I will not let that happen.</i>

202
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,150
<i>Gentlemen, I want this terrorist found...</i>

203
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:44,468
<i>...and I want him to understand
what terror really means.</i>

204
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:46,035
<i>England prevails.</i>

205
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:48,626
England prevails.

206
00:12:54,636 --> 00:12:57,753
- You think people will buy this?
- Why not?

207
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,747
This is the BTN.

208
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,555
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.

209
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:05,107
That's the government's job.

210
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:08,228
On the lighter side of things...

211
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:11,752
...seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the Old Bailey...

212
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,874
...wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.

213
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:18,744
<i>Although the demolition had been
planned for some time...</i>

214
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,874
<i>...the music and the fireworks were,
according to the crew chief...</i>

215
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:24,789
<i>..."definitely not on the schedule."
- We'll be right back.</i>

216
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:28,631
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.

217
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:30,195
I saw it, the whole thing.

218
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:32,945
- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was...

219
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:36,267
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?

220
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:38,827
Evey, there you are.

221
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,066
- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.

222
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:43,511
I need two espressos and three coffees.

223
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:45,587
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.

224
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:48,910
I don't get it.

225
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:52,955
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?

226
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:56,950
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.

227
00:13:57,356 --> 00:13:59,267
Maybe he's just getting started.

228
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:02,395
Yeah?

229
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,787
Okay. A lead on the girl.

230
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:07,754
Look, don't get me wrong, I love it.
A cow getting crucified.

231
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:10,954
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.

232
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,710
You've got to rewrite it, okay?
Gotta go.

233
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:17,276
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.

234
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:19,154
- Mr. Deitrich...
- Gordon, please.

235
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,750
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.

236
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,508
Gordon...

237
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:26,474
...I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen...

238
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:28,149
...and I got scared and went home.

239
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:32,628
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.

240
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:50,710
Gotcha.

241
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,832
- Hey, Fred.
- All that been x-rayed?

242
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,748
Nope. They're filled with bombs.

243
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,111
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?

244
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:03,472
- I can't believe you watch that shit.
- What?

245
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,467
Laser Lass is banging.

246
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:19,745
What's all that?

247
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,874
Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.

248
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:24,628
Must be Prothero.

249
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:28,948
I wish someone had the balls to tell
that brat this station ain't his playground.

250
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:32,469
What the hell is this?

251
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:38,075
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.

252
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:42,350
This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.

253
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:45,553
- They were detained when she was 12.
- What happened to her?

254
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:47,832
Juvenile Reclamation Project...

255
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:49,190
...for five years.
- Shit.

256
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,665
We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.

257
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:53,110
You sure about that, sir?

258
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:54,629
I want a chance to talk to her...

259
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:57,230
...before she disappears
into one of Creedy's black bags.

260
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,065
Who's that?

261
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,911
Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.

262
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:20,945
Fucking hell.

263
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,314
Come on, let's move!

264
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:46,949
You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.

265
00:16:47,116 --> 00:16:48,708
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

266
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:54,424
<i>Will all personnel please
evacuate the building.</i>

267
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:56,308
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

268
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:59,345
<i>Will all personnel evacuate the building.</i>

269
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:06,345
What the hell's going on?

270
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:08,472
- It's jammed.
- Break it down.

271
00:17:13,956 --> 00:17:15,355
Dominic!

272
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:17,675
Police! Out of the way!

273
00:17:19,756 --> 00:17:20,791
Get out the way!

274
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:29,430
Damn it!

275
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:35,111
<i>I'll tell you what I know.
I'll tell you what I know.</i>

276
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:37,836
<i>I'll tell you what I know.
England prevails.</i>

277
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:42,388
- Clear the halls.
- Sir.

278
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,428
<i>Help, Storm, help!</i>

279
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:57,545
Don't touch it.

280
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:59,752
Dad, what's wrong with the telly?

281
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:16,748
<i>Good evening, London.</i>

282
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,074
<i>- Allow me first to apologize...
- That's the emergency channel!</i>

283
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:24,189
<i>I do, like many of you, appreciate
the comforts of the everyday routine...</i>

284
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:28,190
<i>...the security of the familiar,
the tranquility of repetition.</i>

285
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:29,425
Bloody hell.

286
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:32,952
<i>I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
But in the spirit of commemoration...</i>

287
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:34,105
Who's that, Mum?

288
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:36,107
<i>- whereby important events
of the past...</i>

289
00:18:36,276 --> 00:18:38,073
<i>...usually associated
with someone's death...</i>

290
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:40,227
<i>...or the end of some awful,
bloody struggle...</i>

291
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:42,785
<i>...are celebrated with a nice holiday...</i>

292
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,385
<i>...I thought we could mark
this November the 5th...</i>

293
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:47,746
<i>...a day that is, sadly,
no longer remembered...</i>

294
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:52,308
<i>...by taking time out of our daily lives
to sit down and have a little chat.</i>

295
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:55,354
<i>There are, of course,
those who do not want us to speak.</i>

296
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:56,744
Let me think, let me think.

297
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,305
<i>Even now, orders are being shouted
into telephones...</i>

298
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:01,592
<i>...and men with guns
will soon be on their way.</i>

299
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:03,508
- It's Chancellor Sutler.
- Damn it!

300
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:07,828
<i>Why? Because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation...</i>

301
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:10,715
<i>...words will always retain their power.</i>

302
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:13,231
<i>Words offer the means to meaning...</i>

303
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:16,468
<i>...and, for those who will listen,
the enunciation of truth.</i>

304
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:17,955
<i>And the truth is...</i>

305
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:21,392
<i>...there is something terribly wrong
with this country, isn't there?</i>

306
00:19:21,556 --> 00:19:24,787
You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!

307
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,426
<i>Cruelty and injustice,
intolerance and oppression.</i>

308
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:30,826
<i>And where once
you had the freedom to object...</i>

309
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:32,714
<i>...to think and speak as you saw fit...</i>

310
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:35,993
<i>...you now have censors and surveillance
coercing your conformity...</i>

311
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:38,875
<i>...and soliciting submission.
- Cameras. We need cameras.</i>

312
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:41,596
<i>How did this happen? Who's to blame?</i>

313
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:44,874
<i>Certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others.</i>

314
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:46,867
<i>And they will be held accountable.</i>

315
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:49,869
<i>But again, truth be told,
if you're looking for the guilty...</i>

316
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,631
<i>...you need only look into a mirror.</i>

317
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,868
<i>I know why you did it.</i>

318
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:56,628
<i>I know you were afraid.</i>

319
00:19:56,796 --> 00:20:00,186
<i>Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.</i>

320
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:02,950
<i>There were a myriad of problems
which conspired...</i>

321
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:06,347
<i>...to corrupt your reason
and rob you of your common sense.</i>

322
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:08,029
<i>Fear got the best of you.</i>

323
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:12,269
<i>And in your panic, you turned to
the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.</i>

324
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:14,870
<i>He promised you order,
he promised you peace...</i>

325
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:18,631
<i>...and all he demanded in return
was your silent, obedient consent.</i>

326
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:22,391
<i>- Inspector, they're almost through.
- Last night, I sought to end that silence.</i>

327
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,786
<i>Last night,
I destroyed the Old Bailey...</i>

328
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:28,153
<i>...to remind this country
of what it has forgotten.</i>

329
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:33,427
<i>More than 400 years ago, a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of November...</i>

330
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:35,029
<i>...forever in our memory.</i>

331
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:38,711
<i>His hope was to remind the world
that fairness, justice and freedom...</i>

332
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,787
<i>...are more than words.</i>

333
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:42,469
<i>They are perspectives.</i>

334
00:20:42,636 --> 00:20:44,433
<i>So if you've seen nothing...</i>

335
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:48,191
<i>...if the crimes of this government
remain unknown to you...</i>

336
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:52,474
<i>...then I would suggest that you allow
the 5th of November to pass unmarked.</i>

337
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:55,628
<i>But if you see what I see...</i>

338
00:20:55,796 --> 00:21:00,153
<i>...if you feel as I feel,
and if you would seek as I seek...</i>

339
00:21:00,316 --> 00:21:03,114
<i>...then I ask you to stand beside me,
one year from tonight...</i>

340
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:05,346
<i>...outside the gates of Parliament.</i>

341
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,150
<i>And together, we shall give them
a 5th of November...</i>

342
00:21:08,316 --> 00:21:11,353
<i>...that shall never, ever be forgot.</i>

343
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:19,347
Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.

344
00:21:19,516 --> 00:21:20,949
Cover the exits.

345
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:23,789
No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.

346
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,230
Left.

347
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:29,749
You go right.

348
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,474
Spread out.

349
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:40,785
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

350
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,469
Hold your fire!

351
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:52,315
He put masks on all of us.

352
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:53,670
Jesus.

353
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:55,269
- Don't shoot!
- Wait!

354
00:21:55,476 --> 00:21:56,955
- Wait!
- Hold your fire!

355
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,186
Freeze! Nobody move!

356
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:01,506
If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!

357
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:08,547
- Get their masks off.
- Please hurry!

358
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,114
There's a bomb in the control booth.

359
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:13,834
Oh, no.

360
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:18,073
- Get anyone not wearing a mask out.
- Yes, sir.

361
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,431
- Marshal, help carry this man.
- Sir.

362
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:22,075
Everyone else, let's go.

363
00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:31,625
Good God.

364
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:34,071
Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!

365
00:22:42,756 --> 00:22:44,474
Dascomb.

366
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:48,311
Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?

367
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:50,467
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

368
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:51,751
Wait, wait!

369
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:55,271
Don't shoot me, please!
It's him! It's him!

370
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:58,784
On your knees! On your knees!

371
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:01,274
Please! Please don't hurt me!

372
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:28,788
Here we go.

373
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:35,505
I did it.

374
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:37,070
I did it.

375
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:42,990
Freeze!

376
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:45,829
Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.

377
00:23:47,516 --> 00:23:51,987
I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of London's finest.

378
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:56,067
I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.

379
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:58,704
We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.

380
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:00,150
I don't know about that.

381
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:18,188
<i>We're interrupting your regular program
to bring you this terrifying report...</i>

382
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,826
<i>...of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower
which ended only moments ago.</i>

383
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:25,113
<i>A psychotic terrorist,
identified only as the letter V...</i>

384
00:24:25,276 --> 00:24:29,064
<i>...attacked the control booth with
high-powered explosives and weapons...</i>

385
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:33,195
<i>...that he used against unarmed civilians
in order to broadcast a message of hate.</i>

386
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:37,749
<i>We've just received this footage
of a daring police raid.</i>

387
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:43,352
<i>Stop! Stop, stay where you are,
or we'll shoot! Stay where you are!</i>

388
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,665
<i>Now, this is only an initial report...</i>

389
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:51,671
<i>...but at this time, it's believed
that during this heroic raid...</i>

390
00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:53,588
<i>...the terrorist was shot and killed.</i>

391
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:54,905
Bollocks.

392
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,386
<i>Again, from what we've been told
by authorities, the danger is now over.</i>

393
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:00,148
<i>The terrorist is dead.</i>

394
00:25:03,996 --> 00:25:06,715
Right there. What's he thinking?

395
00:25:07,196 --> 00:25:09,266
Is he considering leaving her?

396
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,706
After she just saved him?

397
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:17,755
He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.

398
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,872
Some part of him's human.

399
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:23,833
And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.

400
00:26:47,196 --> 00:26:49,756
- You scared me.
- My apologies.

401
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,710
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, thank you.

402
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:55,185
- What is this place?
- It's my home.

403
00:26:55,356 --> 00:26:58,712
- I call it the Shadow Gallery.
- It's beautiful.

404
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:01,674
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Oh, here and there.

405
00:27:01,836 --> 00:27:05,272
Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.

406
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:07,313
- You stole them?
- Heavens, no.

407
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:09,273
Stealing implies ownership.

408
00:27:09,436 --> 00:27:12,473
You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.

409
00:27:12,636 --> 00:27:14,308
God, if they ever find this place...

410
00:27:14,476 --> 00:27:18,264
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.

411
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,631
You mean, after what you've done.

412
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:23,352
God, what have I done?

413
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,552
I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?

414
00:27:25,716 --> 00:27:29,106
- You did what you thought was right.
- No, I shouldn't have done that.

415
00:27:29,276 --> 00:27:31,153
I must have been out of my mind.

416
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,388
Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?

417
00:27:34,876 --> 00:27:36,309
I think I should go.

418
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:38,467
- May I ask where?
- Home. I have to go home.

419
00:27:38,636 --> 00:27:39,830
They're looking for you.

420
00:27:39,996 --> 00:27:42,430
If they know where you work,
they know where you live.

421
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:47,192
- I have friends, I could stay with them.
- I'm afraid that won't work either.

422
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:50,393
You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us...

423
00:27:50,556 --> 00:27:52,148
...but I couldn't see any other way.

424
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:54,466
You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.

425
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:58,675
If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.

426
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:02,545
They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you...

427
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,627
...in the pursuit of finding me.

428
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:07,071
After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen...

429
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:11,070
...so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:

430
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:12,794
Here, to my home.

431
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,547
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.

432
00:28:16,716 --> 00:28:19,025
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.

433
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:21,107
But I don't even know where this is.

434
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:24,154
You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.

435
00:28:24,316 --> 00:28:28,195
- That'd be enough for a clever man.
- Are you saying that I have to stay here?

436
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:31,587
Only until I'm done. After the 5th,
I no longer think it'll matter.

437
00:28:31,756 --> 00:28:33,633
You mean a year from now?

438
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,514
I have to stay here for a year?

439
00:28:35,676 --> 00:28:38,554
Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.

440
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,308
You should've left me alone.

441
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:42,706
Why didn't you just leave me alone?!

442
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:48,473
- Anything else on the parents?
- Yeah, it ain't good.

443
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:50,592
They were interned at Belmarsh.

444
00:28:50,756 --> 00:28:52,394
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

445
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:55,832
She died in a hunger strike.
He died when the military retook the shed.

446
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:59,154
And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.

447
00:28:59,756 --> 00:29:02,350
- Christ.
- It's nothing but bad luck here.

448
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:06,066
So we know her story.
Now we need his.

449
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:28,150
V?

450
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:34,106
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.

451
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:38,749
I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.

452
00:29:39,796 --> 00:29:41,195
Your hands.

453
00:29:42,716 --> 00:29:44,035
Yes.

454
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:49,748
There, that's better.

455
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,907
I hope I didn't put you off your appetite.

456
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:55,671
- No, please. It's just... Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.

457
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,235
Can I ask what happened?

458
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:01,108
There was a fire. A long time ago.

459
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:03,346
Ancient history, for some.

460
00:30:03,516 --> 00:30:05,268
Not really very good table conversation.

461
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,996
Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?

462
00:30:08,436 --> 00:30:11,633
- Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
- Have a seat.

463
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,915
- It's delicious.
- Good.

464
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:25,034
God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.

465
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:26,390
Where did you get it?

466
00:30:26,556 --> 00:30:29,593
A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.

467
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:33,309
- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.

468
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:34,670
You're insane.

469
00:30:34,836 --> 00:30:38,545
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.

470
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:41,025
<i>- Macbeth.
- Very good.</i>

471
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:43,994
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me...

472
00:30:44,156 --> 00:30:46,351
...and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.

473
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:48,791
Be in plays, movies.

474
00:30:48,956 --> 00:30:52,392
<i>When I was 9, I played Viola
in Twelfth Night. Mum was very proud.</i>

475
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:54,547
Where is your mother now?

476
00:30:54,716 --> 00:30:56,434
She's dead.

477
00:30:56,596 --> 00:30:57,745
I'm sorry.

478
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:02,385
Can I ask about
what you said on the telly?

479
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:04,069
- Did you mean it?
- Every word.

480
00:31:04,236 --> 00:31:08,024
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?

481
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:10,391
There's no certainty, only opportunity.

482
00:31:10,556 --> 00:31:12,990
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up...

483
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:14,987
...Creedy'll black-bag every one of them.

484
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:17,585
People should not be afraid
of their governments.

485
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:19,553
Governments should be afraid
of their people.

486
00:31:19,716 --> 00:31:22,025
And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?

487
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:26,546
The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.

488
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:28,388
Symbols are given power by people.

489
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:32,153
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people...

490
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:34,876
...blowing up a building
can change the world.

491
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,712
I wish I believed that was possible.

492
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:42,234
Every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.

493
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:46,230
<i>I'll tell you what I know.
I know this is not a man.</i>

494
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:49,274
<i>- What is he?
- A man does not wear a mask.</i>

495
00:31:49,436 --> 00:31:52,553
<i>- What is he?
- A man does not threaten civilians.</i>

496
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:56,028
<i>He's what every gutless,
freedom-hating terrorist is:</i>

497
00:31:56,196 --> 00:31:58,346
<i>A goddamn coward!</i>

498
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:02,675
There will be no negotiation.

499
00:32:02,836 --> 00:32:05,225
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.

500
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:08,752
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.

501
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:11,510
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.

502
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:14,986
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!

503
00:32:15,156 --> 00:32:17,829
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.

504
00:32:17,996 --> 00:32:21,113
Find another DOP
or find yourself another job.

505
00:32:23,556 --> 00:32:25,035
<i>I'll tell you what I wish.</i>

506
00:32:25,516 --> 00:32:27,074
<i>I wish I'd been there.</i>

507
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,272
<i>I wish I'd had the chance
for a face-to-face.</i>

508
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:31,154
<i>Just one chance, that's all I'd need.</i>

509
00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:40,070
<i>This so-called V and his accomplice,
Evey Hammond...</i>

510
00:32:40,236 --> 00:32:43,387
<i>...neo-demagogues,
spouting their message of hate.</i>

511
00:32:43,556 --> 00:32:47,947
<i>A delusional and aberrant voice
delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.</i>

512
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:51,665
<i>An ultimatum that was met
with swift and surgically precise justice.</i>

513
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,509
<i>- No mercy!
- The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:</i>

514
00:32:54,676 --> 00:32:56,792
Good guys win, bad guys lose...

515
00:32:56,956 --> 00:33:00,187
...and, as always, England prevails!

516
00:33:02,156 --> 00:33:03,987
Holy Christ! Jesus!

517
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,107
Good evening, Commander Prothero.

518
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,744
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

519
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:12,908
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by...

520
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,192
...any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.

521
00:33:15,356 --> 00:33:17,108
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?

522
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:21,827
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.

523
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:23,668
You wore a uniform in those days.

524
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:28,229
You.

525
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:32,912
- It is you.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past.

526
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:43,868
<i>- Yeah?
- Finch, it's Dascomb.</i>

527
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:47,031
<i>- Dascomb.
- I've already called the chancellor.</i>

528
00:33:47,196 --> 00:33:50,871
<i>- We have to get control of the situation.
- What situation?</i>

529
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:56,190
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.

530
00:33:56,356 --> 00:33:58,824
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London...

531
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,952
...could be devastating to our credibility.

532
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:03,794
Perhaps a stroke?

533
00:34:04,316 --> 00:34:06,591
No, no, it's too horrific.

534
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:10,351
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.

535
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:14,116
- We got any eyes or ears on this?
- No, camcos were cut.

536
00:34:14,276 --> 00:34:18,588
It's the same m.o. as before.
But we got an elevator log ID.

537
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,987
- Let me guess.
- She's in deep, inspector.

538
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:24,025
V?

539
00:34:30,716 --> 00:34:32,593
My fat, metal friend.

540
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,547
Mondego.

541
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:54,870
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.

542
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:58,547
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.

543
00:34:58,716 --> 00:34:59,990
My favorite film:

544
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:04,434
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo,
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.</i>

545
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:07,668
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.</i>

546
00:35:09,036 --> 00:35:10,355
It gets me every time.

547
00:35:10,716 --> 00:35:12,468
- Never seen it.
- Really?

548
00:35:13,116 --> 00:35:15,755
- Would you like to?
- Does it have a happy ending?

549
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:18,067
As only celluloid can deliver.

550
00:35:18,436 --> 00:35:19,869
Okay.

551
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:21,910
Put the sword away.

552
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:24,267
Forensics just wrapped.

553
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:27,947
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.

554
00:35:28,116 --> 00:35:29,868
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.

555
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:31,992
- Drugs?
- Could've started his own hospital.

556
00:35:32,156 --> 00:35:33,669
- Interesting.
- Why?

557
00:35:33,836 --> 00:35:37,112
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country...

558
00:35:37,276 --> 00:35:38,948
...before he was
the Voice of London?

559
00:35:39,116 --> 00:35:41,471
- Drugs?
- Legal ones.

560
00:35:41,636 --> 00:35:44,309
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.

561
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:48,515
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?

562
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:52,066
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.

563
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:54,474
<i>May we come up?</i>

564
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:58,036
<i>- You find your own tree.
- You find your own tree.</i>

565
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:05,232
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

566
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:09,073
- But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
- Why?

567
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:12,909
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.

568
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:17,435
<i>- nationwide were devastated
as news of the most popular...</i>

569
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:18,745
Wait. What's this?

570
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:21,510
<i>- most awarded stars
in the history of the BTN...</i>

571
00:36:21,676 --> 00:36:24,634
<i>...a man known to the entire nation
as "The Voice of London"...</i>

572
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:27,515
<i>...passed away late last night
from apparent heart failure.</i>

573
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:31,754
- She's lying.
- How do you know?

574
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:34,794
She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.

575
00:36:34,956 --> 00:36:37,026
<i>It came as no surprise
to those who knew him...</i>

576
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:38,868
<i>...that his body was at his office...</i>

577
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:42,585
<i>...where he often worked long hours
after everyone else had gone home.</i>

578
00:36:42,756 --> 00:36:45,190
<i>Lewis, you will be sorely missed.</i>

579
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:54,468
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

580
00:36:54,636 --> 00:36:56,274
You didn't take it, did you?

581
00:36:56,796 --> 00:36:59,356
Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

582
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:03,106
Did you have anything to do with that?

583
00:37:03,276 --> 00:37:06,074
- Yes, I killed him.
- You...

584
00:37:06,236 --> 00:37:07,669
- Oh, God.
- You're upset.

585
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:10,191
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

586
00:37:10,356 --> 00:37:13,587
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

587
00:37:13,756 --> 00:37:16,145
- What?
- Violence can be used for good.

588
00:37:16,476 --> 00:37:18,944
- What are you talking about?
- Justice.

589
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:25,106
Oh, I see.

590
00:37:25,436 --> 00:37:27,996
There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

591
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:31,352
And are you going to kill more people?

592
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:34,029
Yes.

593
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,388
Take a look at this.

594
00:37:36,556 --> 00:37:38,911
Prothero's military record.

595
00:37:39,796 --> 00:37:41,149
What do you see?

596
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:47,986
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

597
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:49,714
- Busy boy.
- But after all that...

598
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:53,391
...they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

599
00:37:53,556 --> 00:37:56,229
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

600
00:37:57,436 --> 00:38:00,189
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

601
00:38:00,356 --> 00:38:04,065
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

602
00:38:04,436 --> 00:38:08,395
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

603
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:13,676
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

604
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:17,067
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.

605
00:38:17,236 --> 00:38:20,626
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill...

606
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:23,185
...approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

607
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:24,471
Well, there you have it.

608
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:28,790
This is a matter of some urgency, major.

609
00:38:28,956 --> 00:38:31,993
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

610
00:38:32,316 --> 00:38:34,386
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

611
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:37,195
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

612
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:40,310
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?

613
00:38:40,476 --> 00:38:43,274
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?

614
00:38:43,436 --> 00:38:46,508
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...

615
00:38:46,676 --> 00:38:51,033
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

616
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:53,027
As head of the Detention Program
at that...

617
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:56,905
Before you go further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.

618
00:38:57,516 --> 00:38:59,666
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

619
00:38:59,836 --> 00:39:02,304
We all did what we had to do.

620
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:05,593
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

621
00:39:05,756 --> 00:39:07,508
That's all I have to say about that.

622
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,273
You can do this.

623
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,395
Hi.

624
00:39:27,516 --> 00:39:29,427
I've been thinking...

625
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:32,634
There's something I want to ask you...

626
00:39:32,796 --> 00:39:36,471
...but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

627
00:39:38,716 --> 00:39:41,992
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

628
00:39:42,876 --> 00:39:45,185
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth...

629
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:47,665
...while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

630
00:39:47,836 --> 00:39:49,906
A man after my own heart.

631
00:39:50,076 --> 00:39:52,636
He always told the best stories.

632
00:39:53,836 --> 00:39:55,986
Until my brother died.

633
00:39:58,316 --> 00:40:00,113
That was when everything changed.

634
00:40:00,956 --> 00:40:04,266
<i>My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.</i>

635
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:08,111
<i>After he died,
my parents became political.</i>

636
00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:13,426
<i>They protested the war
and the Reclamation.</i>

637
00:40:13,596 --> 00:40:15,791
<i>When Sutler was appointed
high chancellor...</i>

638
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,072
<i>...they were at the riot in Leeds.</i>

639
00:40:18,236 --> 00:40:20,147
<i>I watched on the television...</i>

640
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:22,625
<i>...thinking I was going
to see my parents killed.</i>

641
00:40:23,196 --> 00:40:25,551
<i>I remember them arguing at night.</i>

642
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:28,913
<i>Mum wanted to leave the country.
Dad refused.</i>

643
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:31,988
<i>He said if we ran away, they would win.</i>

644
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:33,874
<i>Win, like...</i>

645
00:40:34,036 --> 00:40:35,674
<i>...it was a game.</i>

646
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:39,155
Evey, quick, hide!

647
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:55,347
- Mummy!
- Evey!

648
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:56,869
<i>I never saw them again.</i>

649
00:40:57,396 --> 00:41:01,025
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

650
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:02,875
I'm sorry, Evey.

651
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:05,550
No, I'm the one that's sorry.

652
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:07,911
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

653
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:10,954
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

654
00:41:12,276 --> 00:41:13,709
...but I'm not.

655
00:41:14,396 --> 00:41:17,433
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

656
00:41:19,116 --> 00:41:20,435
...but I am.

657
00:41:20,596 --> 00:41:23,986
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

658
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:28,786
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...

659
00:41:29,996 --> 00:41:31,793
...please let me know.

660
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,548
If you wish.

661
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:43,344
Do you really think
you'll find something here?

662
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:44,949
Worth a shot.

663
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:47,792
One thing is true of all governments:

664
00:41:47,956 --> 00:41:51,585
The most reliable records
are tax records.

665
00:41:57,836 --> 00:42:00,987
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

666
00:42:01,156 --> 00:42:04,910
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

667
00:42:05,076 --> 00:42:08,910
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

668
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:11,226
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

669
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:13,751
Thanks. This is a great help.

670
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:28,106
"By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe."

671
00:42:28,276 --> 00:42:31,268
<i>- Personal motto?
- From Faust.</i>

672
00:42:31,436 --> 00:42:33,745
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

673
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:35,986
It is. And speaking of the devil...

674
00:42:36,156 --> 00:42:38,829
...I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

675
00:42:38,996 --> 00:42:41,226
- Of course.
- It appears unforeseen circumstances...

676
00:42:41,396 --> 00:42:44,069
...have accelerated my original plan.

677
00:42:44,236 --> 00:42:47,831
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

678
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:49,190
I'll do my best.

679
00:42:49,676 --> 00:42:51,348
I believe you will.

680
00:42:54,556 --> 00:42:59,505
Another doctor. Why does a
detention facility need so many doctors?

681
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:01,473
I don't know, but this is interesting.

682
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:04,946
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

683
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:08,108
- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.

684
00:43:08,276 --> 00:43:11,951
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

685
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,235
Now, that is interesting.

686
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,634
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

687
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,793
- Your Grace.
- Oh, Denis.

688
00:43:23,956 --> 00:43:25,594
- Has everything been arranged?
- Yes.

689
00:43:25,756 --> 00:43:27,792
I've just received your InterLink itinerary.

690
00:43:27,956 --> 00:43:30,709
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

691
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:32,309
You're most diligent, Denis...

692
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:36,264
...a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...

693
00:43:36,436 --> 00:43:38,870
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

694
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:41,948
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

695
00:43:42,596 --> 00:43:44,268
My last little joy.

696
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:46,108
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

697
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:50,427
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

698
00:43:50,596 --> 00:43:53,713
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

699
00:43:53,876 --> 00:43:55,195
Older?

700
00:43:55,356 --> 00:43:57,426
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

701
00:43:57,596 --> 00:43:59,746
That is for Your Grace to decide.

702
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:13,910
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.

703
00:44:15,476 --> 00:44:20,266
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

704
00:44:22,116 --> 00:44:24,676
Mea culpa, my child.

705
00:44:24,836 --> 00:44:26,064
Mea culpa.

706
00:44:31,476 --> 00:44:34,707
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

707
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:38,755
A confession?
I love the confessional game.

708
00:44:39,236 --> 00:44:40,749
Tell me your sins.

709
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:42,668
This isn't a game, Your Grace.

710
00:44:42,836 --> 00:44:45,031
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

711
00:44:45,276 --> 00:44:46,868
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this...

712
00:44:47,036 --> 00:44:49,504
...because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

713
00:44:49,676 --> 00:44:53,191
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

714
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:56,314
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?

715
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:58,273
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...

716
00:44:58,436 --> 00:45:01,508
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.

717
00:45:01,676 --> 00:45:04,827
I'm telling you that any moment,
he's going to come through that door.

718
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:08,233
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.

719
00:45:08,396 --> 00:45:10,591
Wonderful!

720
00:45:10,756 --> 00:45:12,951
It's a game I've never played!

721
00:45:13,116 --> 00:45:14,993
What a delightful mind you have.

722
00:45:15,156 --> 00:45:16,953
I hope the rest of you
is just as interesting.

723
00:45:17,116 --> 00:45:20,233
- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.

724
00:45:20,396 --> 00:45:22,387
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.

725
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:23,955
Stop it! Get off of me!

726
00:45:24,236 --> 00:45:26,147
Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.

727
00:45:26,316 --> 00:45:28,307
Now, how best to procure
her confession?

728
00:45:30,356 --> 00:45:33,189
You little bitch. You fucking little whore!

729
00:45:35,996 --> 00:45:37,554
- Reverend.
- Oh, my God.

730
00:45:37,716 --> 00:45:39,354
She wasn't lying. It is you.

731
00:45:39,516 --> 00:45:41,427
I'm sorry.

732
00:45:41,596 --> 00:45:43,234
- I had to.
- Evey!

733
00:45:47,836 --> 00:45:49,872
And thus I clothe my naked villainy...

734
00:45:50,036 --> 00:45:52,948
...with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ...

735
00:45:53,116 --> 00:45:56,108
...and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.

736
00:45:56,276 --> 00:45:58,153
Oh, please, have mercy.

737
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:00,153
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.

738
00:46:00,316 --> 00:46:01,954
<i>Not tonight.</i>

739
00:46:04,396 --> 00:46:05,909
<i>Don't do this, I beg of you.</i>

740
00:46:06,076 --> 00:46:08,146
Well, then. Children's hour at the abbey.

741
00:46:08,316 --> 00:46:10,227
<i>Open your mouth
and stick out your tongue.</i>

742
00:46:10,396 --> 00:46:13,593
<i>- What the...?
- I don't want to die!</i>

743
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,830
This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.

744
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:23,071
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.

745
00:46:23,236 --> 00:46:24,828
- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.

746
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:27,471
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.

747
00:46:28,196 --> 00:46:30,790
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.

748
00:46:35,316 --> 00:46:36,669
Creedy.

749
00:46:36,956 --> 00:46:38,150
What are you doing here?

750
00:46:39,076 --> 00:46:42,989
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.

751
00:46:43,156 --> 00:46:47,195
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.

752
00:46:47,356 --> 00:46:50,075
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.

753
00:46:50,236 --> 00:46:53,114
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.

754
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:56,348
The security of information
is paramount.

755
00:46:56,876 --> 00:46:58,275
In these volatile times...

756
00:46:58,436 --> 00:47:01,155
...mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated...

757
00:47:01,316 --> 00:47:03,591
...if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.

758
00:47:03,756 --> 00:47:05,906
- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have...

759
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:08,590
...a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

760
00:47:08,756 --> 00:47:11,429
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

761
00:47:11,836 --> 00:47:14,031
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

762
00:47:14,196 --> 00:47:15,868
At this time, it would behoove you...

763
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:20,826
...to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed...

764
00:47:20,996 --> 00:47:24,272
...and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

765
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:26,144
You mean Larkhill?

766
00:47:26,316 --> 00:47:29,752
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

767
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:33,033
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?

768
00:47:34,196 --> 00:47:36,949
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

769
00:47:37,596 --> 00:47:40,633
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

770
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:44,312
I've been a party member for 27 years.

771
00:47:44,476 --> 00:47:46,706
If I were you, chief inspector...

772
00:47:46,876 --> 00:47:48,946
...I'd find the terrorist...

773
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,947
...and I'd find him soon.

774
00:47:54,196 --> 00:47:55,675
Please.

775
00:47:59,716 --> 00:48:01,707
Evey? Good God!

776
00:48:01,876 --> 00:48:04,310
I'm sorry.
I didn't know where else to go.

777
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:09,074
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.

778
00:48:17,236 --> 00:48:19,750
- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.

779
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:22,476
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.

780
00:48:22,636 --> 00:48:24,945
- Evey...
- You could be in terrible trouble.

781
00:48:25,116 --> 00:48:26,549
Evey, listen to me.

782
00:48:26,716 --> 00:48:30,391
If the government searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

783
00:48:34,436 --> 00:48:35,994
You trusted me.

784
00:48:36,156 --> 00:48:39,114
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

785
00:48:51,836 --> 00:48:54,225
<i>Oh, my God.
That's God Save the Queen.</i>

786
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:56,990
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

787
00:48:57,196 --> 00:49:01,075
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.

788
00:49:01,236 --> 00:49:03,909
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel...

789
00:49:04,076 --> 00:49:05,828
...it always cheers me up.

790
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:11,755
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

791
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,986
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.

792
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:16,109
But why would you keep it?

793
00:49:16,276 --> 00:49:19,348
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful, poetry moving.

794
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:21,427
Is it worth it?
If they found that here...

795
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:23,791
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

796
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:26,273
Thank you, Gordon.

797
00:49:26,436 --> 00:49:28,472
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.

798
00:49:28,636 --> 00:49:31,992
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.

799
00:49:32,156 --> 00:49:34,226
I was on my way here, and...

800
00:49:35,996 --> 00:49:37,395
Yes.

801
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:42,865
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

802
00:49:43,716 --> 00:49:45,115
- But...
- You're wondering why...

803
00:49:45,276 --> 00:49:47,710
...you were invited here to supper
in the first place...

804
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:51,789
...if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

805
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:55,346
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain...

806
00:49:55,516 --> 00:49:58,030
...young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

807
00:49:58,236 --> 00:50:01,831
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired...

808
00:50:01,996 --> 00:50:05,784
...I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a TV show.

809
00:50:05,956 --> 00:50:08,789
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

810
00:50:10,076 --> 00:50:11,873
The truth is, after so many years...

811
00:50:12,036 --> 00:50:15,346
...you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

812
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:19,350
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

813
00:50:20,836 --> 00:50:24,954
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

814
00:50:25,116 --> 00:50:27,994
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.

815
00:50:29,156 --> 00:50:30,635
Thanks, Delia.

816
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:34,627
Any leads on finding this guy?

817
00:50:34,796 --> 00:50:37,993
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.

818
00:50:40,636 --> 00:50:43,548
You started as a botanist, didn't you?

819
00:50:44,956 --> 00:50:47,265
It's... It's a Scarlet Carson.

820
00:50:48,716 --> 00:50:50,946
They're believed to be extinct.

821
00:50:52,396 --> 00:50:53,909
He leaves them at the crime scenes.

822
00:50:54,556 --> 00:50:56,672
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.

823
00:50:56,876 --> 00:50:59,310
Any information could be helpful.

824
00:51:00,076 --> 00:51:01,555
Of course.

825
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:04,229
Excuse me.

826
00:51:04,956 --> 00:51:06,105
Yeah?

827
00:51:06,276 --> 00:51:10,394
<i>I just finished going through the file,
inspector. You better get back here.</i>

828
00:51:10,556 --> 00:51:11,955
Yeah, okay.

829
00:51:13,636 --> 00:51:16,628
- My God. He's killed them all.
- All but one.

830
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:20,105
- Who is she?
- Not sure.

831
00:51:20,276 --> 00:51:22,710
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.

832
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:26,232
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

833
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:28,910
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.

834
00:51:29,476 --> 00:51:30,875
Running away?

835
00:51:31,036 --> 00:51:35,029
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

836
00:51:35,196 --> 00:51:37,471
- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.

837
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,594
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.

838
00:51:40,756 --> 00:51:43,953
- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.

839
00:51:55,836 --> 00:51:57,155
What? Are you sure about that?

840
00:51:57,636 --> 00:51:58,989
Okay. Thank you.

841
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:03,192
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.

842
00:52:03,516 --> 00:52:05,507
- The coroner?
- Yeah.

843
00:52:06,276 --> 00:52:07,675
Jesus, I just saw her.

844
00:52:16,356 --> 00:52:18,108
It's you, isn't it?

845
00:52:18,756 --> 00:52:21,714
- You've come to kill me.
- Yes.

846
00:52:23,116 --> 00:52:24,947
Thank God.

847
00:52:26,996 --> 00:52:29,351
<i>I'm sorry, I can't get a response
from that number.</i>

848
00:52:29,516 --> 00:52:31,347
<i>There's a problem with the connection.</i>

849
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:33,268
Jesus Christ.

850
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:35,195
He's there.

851
00:52:36,196 --> 00:52:39,472
After what happened,
after what they did...

852
00:52:39,876 --> 00:52:41,867
...I thought about killing myself.

853
00:52:44,076 --> 00:52:47,034
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.

854
00:52:48,276 --> 00:52:50,392
I didn't know what
they were going to do.

855
00:52:51,156 --> 00:52:52,669
I swear to you.

856
00:52:52,996 --> 00:52:54,395
Read my journal.

857
00:52:54,556 --> 00:52:57,673
What they did was only possible
because of you.

858
00:52:59,316 --> 00:53:02,911
Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.

859
00:53:03,076 --> 00:53:05,795
He changed the entire course
of human history.

860
00:53:06,996 --> 00:53:09,464
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?

861
00:53:09,676 --> 00:53:12,668
I have not come
for what you hoped to do.

862
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:14,633
I've come for what you did.

863
00:53:16,156 --> 00:53:17,305
It's funny.

864
00:53:17,476 --> 00:53:20,195
I was given one of your roses today.

865
00:53:21,396 --> 00:53:24,468
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.

866
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:30,071
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.

867
00:53:31,116 --> 00:53:33,584
There are no coincidences, Delia.

868
00:53:33,756 --> 00:53:36,634
Only the illusion of coincidence.

869
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,707
I have another rose.

870
00:53:39,836 --> 00:53:42,066
And this one is for you.

871
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:51,190
- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 10 minutes ago...

872
00:53:51,956 --> 00:53:53,674
...while you slept.

873
00:53:54,676 --> 00:53:57,270
- Is there any pain?
- No.

874
00:53:57,516 --> 00:53:58,835
Thank you.

875
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:04,153
Is it meaningless to apologize?

876
00:54:04,556 --> 00:54:05,591
Never.

877
00:54:06,756 --> 00:54:08,633
I'm so sorry.

878
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:31,034
Damn it.

879
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,155
The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.

880
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:39,752
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.

881
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:42,828
<i>Am I to understand that you have read
this document, inspector?</i>

882
00:54:43,036 --> 00:54:44,992
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Has anyone else read it?</i>

883
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,909
<i>- No, sir.
- Then let me make this perfectly clear.</i>

884
00:54:48,116 --> 00:54:51,426
<i>The contents of this document
are a matter of national security...</i>

885
00:54:51,596 --> 00:54:55,305
<i>...constituting an assault on the character
of several important party members...</i>

886
00:54:55,676 --> 00:54:58,793
<i>...as well as a blatant violation
of the Articles of Allegiance.</i>

887
00:54:58,956 --> 00:55:01,754
<i>As the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified...</i>

888
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:05,591
<i>...it could be an elaborate forgery
created by the terrorist...</i>

889
00:55:05,756 --> 00:55:09,271
<i>...as easily as it could be the deranged
fantasy of a former party member...</i>

890
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:11,506
<i>...who resigned
for psychological reasons.</i>

891
00:55:11,996 --> 00:55:14,464
<i>Any discussion of this document
or its contents...</i>

892
00:55:14,636 --> 00:55:17,434
<i>...will be regarded, at the very least,
as an act of sedition...</i>

893
00:55:17,596 --> 00:55:19,985
<i>...if not a willful act of treason.</i>

894
00:55:20,156 --> 00:55:23,353
<i>- Is that understood, Mr. Finch?
- Yes, sir.</i>

895
00:55:23,516 --> 00:55:26,076
<i>You would do well, inspector...</i>

896
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:28,545
<i>...to put it out of your mind.</i>

897
00:55:37,316 --> 00:55:39,034
<i>May 23rd.</i>

898
00:55:40,316 --> 00:55:43,069
<i>My first batch of subjects
arrived today...</i>

899
00:55:44,076 --> 00:55:46,829
<i>...and I have to admit
that I'm very excited.</i>

900
00:55:49,836 --> 00:55:52,555
<i>This could be the dawn of a new age.</i>

901
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,347
<i>Nuclear power is meaningless...</i>

902
00:55:55,516 --> 00:55:58,394
<i>...in a world where a virus
can kill an entire population...</i>

903
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:00,512
<i>...and leave its wealth intact.</i>

904
00:56:00,676 --> 00:56:03,668
- Stay together!
- Come on, move!

905
00:56:04,156 --> 00:56:06,067
<i>May 27th.</i>

906
00:56:06,236 --> 00:56:09,228
<i>Commander Prothero toured the lab
with a priest, Father Lilliman...</i>

907
00:56:09,396 --> 00:56:13,071
<i>...who I was told is here to monitor
for Rules and Rights violations.</i>

908
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:17,309
<i>It made me nervous, but the commander
assured me there wouldn't be a problem.</i>

909
00:56:17,516 --> 00:56:19,268
<i>June 2nd.</i>

910
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,471
<i>I keep wondering if these people knew
how they might be helping their country...</i>

911
00:56:23,636 --> 00:56:25,866
<i>...if they would act any differently.</i>

912
00:56:26,036 --> 00:56:29,790
<i>They're so weak and pathetic.
They never look you in the eye.</i>

913
00:56:29,956 --> 00:56:32,311
<i>I find myself hating them.</i>

914
00:56:35,316 --> 00:56:37,147
<i>August the 18th.</i>

915
00:56:37,316 --> 00:56:40,945
<i>Of the original four dozen,
over 75 percent are now deceased.</i>

916
00:56:43,356 --> 00:56:46,473
<i>No controllable pattern has yet emerged.</i>

917
00:56:48,116 --> 00:56:49,834
<i>September the 18th.</i>

918
00:56:49,996 --> 00:56:52,954
<i>There is one case that continues
to give me hope.</i>

919
00:56:53,116 --> 00:56:57,587
<i>He exhibits none of the immune-system
pathologies the other subjects developed.</i>

920
00:56:57,756 --> 00:57:02,068
<i>I've discovered cellular anomalies in his
blood that I've been unable to categorize.</i>

921
00:57:02,236 --> 00:57:03,988
<i>The mutations seem to have triggered...</i>

922
00:57:04,156 --> 00:57:07,944
<i>...the abnormal development
of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.</i>

923
00:57:08,116 --> 00:57:10,186
<i>The subject said
he could no longer remember...</i>

924
00:57:10,356 --> 00:57:12,950
<i>...who he was or where he was from.</i>

925
00:57:13,116 --> 00:57:16,745
<i>Whoever he was,
he is now the key to our dream...</i>

926
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:20,306
<i>...and the hope that all of this
will not have been in vain.</i>

927
00:57:21,516 --> 00:57:22,949
<i>November the 5th.</i>

928
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:28,353
<i>It started last night, around midnight.</i>

929
00:57:28,516 --> 00:57:32,225
<i>The first explosions tore open
the entire medical section.</i>

930
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:36,069
<i>All my work, gone.</i>

931
00:57:36,236 --> 00:57:40,115
<i>I was trying to understand how
it could've happened when I saw him.</i>

932
00:57:40,276 --> 00:57:42,392
<i>The man from room 5.</i>

933
00:57:42,556 --> 00:57:43,750
<i>He looked at me.</i>

934
00:57:43,916 --> 00:57:47,192
<i>Not with eyes. There were no eyes.</i>

935
00:57:47,356 --> 00:57:49,790
<i>But I know he was looking at me
because I felt it.</i>

936
00:57:57,036 --> 00:57:58,992
<i>Oh, God...</i>

937
00:57:59,156 --> 00:58:00,794
<i>...what have I done?</i>

938
00:58:31,636 --> 00:58:32,989
What is that you're making?

939
00:58:33,156 --> 00:58:35,590
We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.

940
00:58:35,756 --> 00:58:37,508
- This is weird.
- What?

941
00:58:37,676 --> 00:58:40,986
The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.

942
00:58:41,156 --> 00:58:43,351
- Really?
- I swear.

943
00:58:43,516 --> 00:58:48,112
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.

944
00:58:48,276 --> 00:58:50,107
- There is?
- Yes, Evey.

945
00:58:50,436 --> 00:58:52,028
I am V.

946
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,595
At last you know the truth.

947
00:58:54,076 --> 00:58:55,395
You're stunned, I know.

948
00:58:55,556 --> 00:58:59,026
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...

949
00:58:59,196 --> 00:59:04,190
...there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.

950
00:59:06,036 --> 00:59:07,355
That is not funny, Gordon.

951
00:59:07,516 --> 00:59:10,076
Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.

952
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:12,712
I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.

953
00:59:12,876 --> 00:59:14,707
Of course, he was right, wasn't he?

954
00:59:15,796 --> 00:59:18,071
There is something wrong
with this country.

955
00:59:33,516 --> 00:59:34,949
Morning, inspector.

956
00:59:36,636 --> 00:59:38,308
You're at it early.

957
00:59:39,836 --> 00:59:43,351
Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.

958
00:59:51,276 --> 00:59:53,665
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.

959
00:59:54,996 --> 00:59:57,271
I don't care if you answer me or not.

960
00:59:58,196 --> 01:00:00,312
I just wanna say this aloud.

961
01:00:01,516 --> 01:00:05,111
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.

962
01:00:05,276 --> 01:00:07,506
Yeah, of course, inspector, but...

963
01:00:08,556 --> 01:00:09,909
Because of the terrorist?

964
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,590
No.

965
01:00:13,716 --> 01:00:16,674
So, what is it, chief? What's going on?

966
01:00:19,356 --> 01:00:22,712
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's...

967
01:00:23,596 --> 01:00:24,915
...and Three Waters.

968
01:00:26,996 --> 01:00:31,194
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours...

969
01:00:31,356 --> 01:00:34,075
...the question I have to ask, is:

970
01:00:35,516 --> 01:00:38,269
What if the worst...

971
01:00:38,956 --> 01:00:42,392
...the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history...

972
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:46,151
...was not the work
of religious extremists?

973
01:00:46,316 --> 01:00:49,831
I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

974
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:52,032
And they were executed. I know.

975
01:00:52,196 --> 01:00:55,074
And maybe that's really what happened.

976
01:00:57,316 --> 01:00:59,830
But I see this chain of events...

977
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:04,552
...these coincidences,
and I have to ask:

978
01:01:04,716 --> 01:01:06,229
What if that isn't what happened?

979
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,229
What if someone else
unleashed that virus?

980
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:13,275
What if someone else
killed all those people?

981
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,666
Would you really wanna know
who it was?

982
01:01:16,636 --> 01:01:17,989
Sure.

983
01:01:18,156 --> 01:01:20,386
Even if it was someone
working for this government?

984
01:01:22,236 --> 01:01:23,749
That's my question.

985
01:01:24,196 --> 01:01:26,869
If our own government
was responsible...

986
01:01:27,036 --> 01:01:31,154
...for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...

987
01:01:33,036 --> 01:01:35,231
...if our own government
was responsible...

988
01:01:35,396 --> 01:01:39,355
...for the deaths
of almost 100,000 people...

989
01:01:41,996 --> 01:01:43,588
...would you really wanna know?

990
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:46,112
<i>This has to be the bloody coldest
March in years.</i>

991
01:01:46,276 --> 01:01:48,665
<i>Keep talking like that,
we'll lose our party status.</i>

992
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:52,306
<i>- They're a pack of lying hypocrites!
- Keep it down, will you?</i>

993
01:01:56,076 --> 01:01:59,193
Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now...

994
01:01:59,356 --> 01:02:02,428
...80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.

995
01:02:03,156 --> 01:02:05,272
We're also showing
a 12-percent increase...

996
01:02:05,436 --> 01:02:08,746
...over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.

997
01:02:08,916 --> 01:02:12,272
<i>- Mr. Creedy?
- We're handling it as best we can.</i>

998
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:14,950
Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.

999
01:02:15,116 --> 01:02:17,505
<i>I want more than arrests. I want results.</i>

1000
01:02:21,236 --> 01:02:23,670
- What's all this about?
- I'm celebrating.

1001
01:02:23,836 --> 01:02:25,872
Celebrating what?

1002
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:28,948
I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.

1003
01:02:29,116 --> 01:02:30,834
<i>Very good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1004
01:02:31,996 --> 01:02:35,113
<i>Listen, we've got an extraordinary
show for you tonight.</i>

1005
01:02:35,396 --> 01:02:38,547
<i>You're not gonna believe it.
As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.</i>

1006
01:02:38,716 --> 01:02:41,105
<i>Will you please give
a very warm welcome...</i>

1007
01:02:41,276 --> 01:02:44,507
<i>...to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!</i>

1008
01:02:48,836 --> 01:02:50,349
- No way!
- No, it can't be!

1009
01:02:52,116 --> 01:02:55,506
We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.

1010
01:02:55,676 --> 01:02:57,189
Oh, my God.

1011
01:03:09,196 --> 01:03:10,868
<i>Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor...</i>

1012
01:03:11,036 --> 01:03:13,755
<i>...I understand you've been under
tremendous strain lately...</i>

1013
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,953
<i>...since the beginning
of this whole terrorism business...</i>

1014
01:03:17,116 --> 01:03:21,029
<i>...and we thought it would be a nice idea
to try and help you relax. Girls?</i>

1015
01:03:26,956 --> 01:03:30,073
<i>Warm milk. There's nothing better.</i>

1016
01:03:30,236 --> 01:03:33,148
<i>I understand you enjoy a glass
every night, chancellor.</i>

1017
01:03:33,316 --> 01:03:35,034
<i>Since I was a boy.</i>

1018
01:03:36,076 --> 01:03:37,589
<i>But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.</i>

1019
01:03:37,756 --> 01:03:41,385
<i>- The terrorist was never a concern.
- Oh, really?</i>

1020
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:43,672
<i>- Chancellor, chancellor...
- It's him.</i>

1021
01:03:43,836 --> 01:03:46,953
<i>Are you saying that he's not still alive
and active?</i>

1022
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:49,676
<i>The terrorist has been neutralized.</i>

1023
01:03:51,276 --> 01:03:53,870
<i>Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!</i>

1024
01:03:54,036 --> 01:03:55,594
<i>The terrorist!</i>

1025
01:03:56,156 --> 01:03:57,589
<i>The terrorist!</i>

1026
01:03:59,276 --> 01:04:00,914
<i>Get him!</i>

1027
01:04:03,236 --> 01:04:05,272
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

1028
01:04:23,676 --> 01:04:25,189
<i>At last!</i>

1029
01:04:25,356 --> 01:04:29,110
<i>And now, for all the world to see.</i>

1030
01:04:30,236 --> 01:04:31,430
It's him!

1031
01:04:32,556 --> 01:04:36,390
<i>Unhand me! I am your chancellor!</i>

1032
01:04:36,556 --> 01:04:40,105
<i>How dare you! I am the chancellor!</i>

1033
01:04:40,396 --> 01:04:42,227
<i>Imposter!</i>

1034
01:04:48,436 --> 01:04:50,552
<i>Soldiers! That man is the terrorist!</i>

1035
01:04:50,716 --> 01:04:53,514
<i>- I order you to shoot that traitor!
- Liar!</i>

1036
01:04:53,676 --> 01:04:54,665
<i>- Faker!
- Fraud!</i>

1037
01:04:54,836 --> 01:04:56,633
<i>- Ready!
- Aim!</i>

1038
01:04:56,796 --> 01:04:58,195
<i>- Fire!
- Fire!</i>

1039
01:05:09,596 --> 01:05:11,507
What are they gonna do, fine us?

1040
01:05:11,676 --> 01:05:14,986
Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.

1041
01:05:15,156 --> 01:05:17,545
Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.

1042
01:05:17,716 --> 01:05:19,513
Protect me.

1043
01:05:19,676 --> 01:05:21,428
I should've hired him
to be my mother.

1044
01:05:21,596 --> 01:05:24,235
- You're mad.
- Either that or I wasn't breast-fed.

1045
01:05:24,396 --> 01:05:27,274
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Only the things that matter.

1046
01:05:27,436 --> 01:05:30,553
- What if they come after you?
- I tell you what's gonna happen.

1047
01:05:30,716 --> 01:05:33,753
I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.

1048
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:38,706
In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.

1049
01:05:45,853 --> 01:05:47,047
Gordon?

1050
01:05:49,453 --> 01:05:51,125
Quick, Evey, hide!

1051
01:06:05,533 --> 01:06:08,684
Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?

1052
01:06:57,053 --> 01:06:58,566
- Gotcha.
- No, no.

1053
01:07:11,413 --> 01:07:14,485
Do you know why you're here,
Evey Hammond?

1054
01:07:15,693 --> 01:07:16,887
Please.

1055
01:07:17,053 --> 01:07:19,362
You've been charged
with three counts of murder...

1056
01:07:19,853 --> 01:07:23,209
...the bombing of government property,
conspiracy to commit terrorism...

1057
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:28,083
...treason and sedition, the penalty
for which is death by firing squad.

1058
01:07:29,293 --> 01:07:34,413
You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.

1059
01:07:34,573 --> 01:07:38,407
You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts...

1060
01:07:38,573 --> 01:07:40,325
...of code name V.

1061
01:07:41,013 --> 01:07:43,527
If your information leads
to his capture...

1062
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:47,322
...you will be released
from this facility immediately.

1063
01:07:47,493 --> 01:07:49,961
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

1064
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:53,125
You can return to your life,
Miss Hammond.

1065
01:07:54,173 --> 01:07:57,449
All you have to do is cooperate.

1066
01:08:01,693 --> 01:08:03,206
Process her.

1067
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:08,328
<i>I know there's no way I can convince you
this is not one of their tricks...</i>

1068
01:10:08,493 --> 01:10:09,812
<i>...but I don't care.</i>

1069
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:11,691
<i>I am me.</i>

1070
01:10:11,853 --> 01:10:13,525
<i>My name is Valerie.</i>

1071
01:10:13,693 --> 01:10:18,528
<i>I don't think I'll live much longer.
I wanted to tell someone about my life.</i>

1072
01:10:18,693 --> 01:10:22,891
<i>This is the only autobiography
that I will ever write and, God...</i>

1073
01:10:23,373 --> 01:10:25,682
<i>...I'm writing it on toilet paper.</i>

1074
01:10:28,013 --> 01:10:31,130
<i>I was born in Nottingham in 1985.</i>

1075
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,568
<i>I don't remember much
of those early years...</i>

1076
01:10:33,733 --> 01:10:35,883
<i>...but I do remember the rain.</i>

1077
01:10:36,053 --> 01:10:38,408
<i>My grandmother owned a farm
in Tottle Brook...</i>

1078
01:10:38,573 --> 01:10:41,326
<i>...and she used to tell me
that God was in the rain.</i>

1079
01:10:41,493 --> 01:10:44,166
<i>I passed my 11 Plus
and went to girls ' grammar.</i>

1080
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:46,927
<i>It was at school
that I met my first girlfriend.</i>

1081
01:10:47,093 --> 01:10:48,651
<i>Her name was Sarah.</i>

1082
01:10:49,213 --> 01:10:50,726
<i>It was her wrists.</i>

1083
01:10:50,893 --> 01:10:52,485
<i>They were beautiful.</i>

1084
01:10:55,013 --> 01:10:57,208
<i>I thought we would
love each other forever.</i>

1085
01:10:57,893 --> 01:10:59,963
<i>I remember our teacher telling us...</i>

1086
01:11:00,133 --> 01:11:02,727
<i>...that it was an adolescent phase
that people outgrew.</i>

1087
01:11:02,893 --> 01:11:04,372
<i>Sarah did.</i>

1088
01:11:05,853 --> 01:11:07,605
<i>I didn't.</i>

1089
01:11:07,813 --> 01:11:11,772
<i>In 2002, I fell in love
with a girl named Christina.</i>

1090
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:14,049
<i>That year I came out to my parents.</i>

1091
01:11:14,213 --> 01:11:17,728
<i>I couldn't have done it
without Chris holding my hand.</i>

1092
01:11:17,893 --> 01:11:22,842
<i>My father wouldn't look at me.
He told me to go and never come back.</i>

1093
01:11:23,013 --> 01:11:24,605
<i>My mother said nothing.</i>

1094
01:11:25,493 --> 01:11:29,281
<i>But I'd only told them the truth.
Was that so selfish?</i>

1095
01:11:29,893 --> 01:11:34,091
<i>Our integrity sells for so little,
but it is all we really have.</i>

1096
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:36,323
<i>It is the very last inch of us.</i>

1097
01:11:37,133 --> 01:11:38,930
<i>But within that inch...</i>

1098
01:11:39,093 --> 01:11:40,287
<i>...we are free.</i>

1099
01:11:42,893 --> 01:11:44,451
It ends whenever you want it to.

1100
01:11:44,613 --> 01:11:47,081
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.

1101
01:12:22,253 --> 01:12:24,562
<i>I'd always known
what I wanted to do with my life...</i>

1102
01:12:24,733 --> 01:12:29,727
<i>...and in 2015 I starred in my first film,
The Salt Flats.</i>

1103
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:34,483
<i>It was the most important role of my life.
Not because of my career...</i>

1104
01:12:34,653 --> 01:12:36,564
<i>...but because that was how I met Ruth.</i>

1105
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:40,326
<i>The first time we kissed...</i>

1106
01:12:40,973 --> 01:12:45,091
<i>...I knew I never wanted to kiss
any other lips but hers again.</i>

1107
01:12:51,253 --> 01:12:53,972
<i>We moved to a small flat
in London together.</i>

1108
01:12:54,133 --> 01:12:56,567
<i>She grew Scarlet Carsons for me
in our window box...</i>

1109
01:12:57,533 --> 01:13:00,172
<i>...and our place always smelt of roses.</i>

1110
01:13:01,973 --> 01:13:04,487
<i>Those were the best years of my life.</i>

1111
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:12,291
<i>But America's war grew worse and worse,
and eventually came to London.</i>

1112
01:13:12,453 --> 01:13:15,445
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler...

1113
01:13:15,613 --> 01:13:18,411
...to close the remaining tube stations
passed with...

1114
01:13:18,573 --> 01:13:21,292
<i>After that, there were no roses anymore.</i>

1115
01:13:21,893 --> 01:13:23,121
<i>Not for anyone.</i>

1116
01:13:23,293 --> 01:13:25,284
You won't last much longer.

1117
01:13:25,453 --> 01:13:27,045
You're gonna die here.

1118
01:13:27,213 --> 01:13:30,171
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?

1119
01:13:40,573 --> 01:13:43,804
<i>I remember how the meaning of words
began to change.</i>

1120
01:13:44,973 --> 01:13:50,252
<i>How unfamiliar words like "collateral"
and "rendition" became frightening...</i>

1121
01:13:50,853 --> 01:13:55,449
<i>...while things like "Norsefire" and the
"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.</i>

1122
01:13:55,853 --> 01:13:59,209
<i>I remember how "different"
became dangerous.</i>

1123
01:13:59,373 --> 01:14:01,762
<i>I still don't understand it...</i>

1124
01:14:01,933 --> 01:14:03,924
<i>...why they hate us so much.</i>

1125
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:12,001
<i>They took Ruth
while she was out buying food.</i>

1126
01:14:14,613 --> 01:14:17,127
<i>I've never cried so hard in my life.</i>

1127
01:14:18,653 --> 01:14:20,723
<i>It wasn't long till they came for me.</i>

1128
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:32,092
<i>It seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place.</i>

1129
01:14:32,253 --> 01:14:37,452
<i>But for three years,
I had roses and apologized to no one.</i>

1130
01:14:40,173 --> 01:14:41,686
<i>I shall die here.</i>

1131
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:45,243
<i>Every inch of me shall perish.</i>

1132
01:14:45,413 --> 01:14:47,051
<i>Every inch...</i>

1133
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:48,807
<i>...but one.</i>

1134
01:14:52,813 --> 01:14:54,405
<i>An inch.</i>

1135
01:14:55,133 --> 01:14:57,601
<i>It is small, and it is fragile...</i>

1136
01:14:57,773 --> 01:15:01,288
<i>...and it is the only thing
in the world worth having.</i>

1137
01:15:01,453 --> 01:15:06,368
<i>We must never lose it or give it away.
We must never let them take it from us.</i>

1138
01:15:07,093 --> 01:15:11,291
<i>I hope that, whoever you are,
you escape this place.</i>

1139
01:15:11,453 --> 01:15:14,525
<i>I hope that the world turns
and that things get better.</i>

1140
01:15:15,973 --> 01:15:19,409
<i>But what I hope most of all
is that you understand what I mean...</i>

1141
01:15:19,573 --> 01:15:22,645
<i>...when I tell you that
even though I do not know you...</i>

1142
01:15:22,813 --> 01:15:25,452
<i>...and even though
I may never meet you...</i>

1143
01:15:25,613 --> 01:15:28,730
<i>...laugh with you, cry with you...</i>

1144
01:15:28,893 --> 01:15:30,724
<i>...or kiss you...</i>

1145
01:15:31,173 --> 01:15:32,925
<i>...I love you.</i>

1146
01:15:33,093 --> 01:15:35,527
<i>With all my heart...</i>

1147
01:15:35,773 --> 01:15:37,604
<i>...I love you.</i>

1148
01:15:39,213 --> 01:15:40,566
<i>Valerie.</i>

1149
01:15:52,773 --> 01:15:57,289
I'm instructed to inform you that you
have been convicted by special tribunal...

1150
01:15:57,453 --> 01:16:00,286
...and that unless you are ready
to offer your cooperation...

1151
01:16:00,453 --> 01:16:02,250
...you are to be executed.

1152
01:16:02,413 --> 01:16:06,008
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1153
01:16:07,013 --> 01:16:09,686
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?

1154
01:16:12,733 --> 01:16:15,531
- No.
- Very well.

1155
01:16:17,493 --> 01:16:20,166
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.

1156
01:16:21,253 --> 01:16:22,686
Arrange a detail of six men...

1157
01:16:22,853 --> 01:16:25,686
...and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.

1158
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,241
It's time.

1159
01:16:43,853 --> 01:16:45,206
I'm ready.

1160
01:16:46,853 --> 01:16:49,447
Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.

1161
01:16:49,613 --> 01:16:51,808
Just give them something, anything.

1162
01:16:52,693 --> 01:16:54,092
Thank you...

1163
01:16:54,253 --> 01:16:57,131
...but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.

1164
01:16:57,293 --> 01:17:01,411
Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.

1165
01:17:07,253 --> 01:17:08,447
What?

1166
01:18:29,253 --> 01:18:30,686
Hello, Evey.

1167
01:18:32,173 --> 01:18:33,401
You.

1168
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:38,212
- It was you?
- Yeah.

1169
01:18:38,573 --> 01:18:40,211
That wasn't real?

1170
01:18:42,573 --> 01:18:46,407
- Is Gordon...?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.

1171
01:18:46,573 --> 01:18:47,926
I thought they'd arrest him...

1172
01:18:48,093 --> 01:18:51,210
...but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.

1173
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:53,286
Oh, God.

1174
01:18:53,933 --> 01:18:57,369
- Fortunately, I got to you before they did.
- You got to me?

1175
01:18:59,053 --> 01:19:00,805
You did this to me?

1176
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:03,686
You cut my hair?

1177
01:19:05,293 --> 01:19:06,521
You tortured me?

1178
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:09,085
You tortured me.

1179
01:19:10,573 --> 01:19:11,722
Why?

1180
01:19:12,853 --> 01:19:17,131
You said you wanted to live without fear.
I wish there'd been an easier way...

1181
01:19:17,293 --> 01:19:19,249
...but there wasn't.
- Oh, my God.

1182
01:19:19,413 --> 01:19:21,244
I know you may never forgive me...

1183
01:19:21,773 --> 01:19:24,333
...but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.

1184
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:27,451
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.

1185
01:19:27,853 --> 01:19:29,923
Every day, I wanted to end it.

1186
01:19:30,093 --> 01:19:33,529
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.

1187
01:19:33,693 --> 01:19:36,332
You're sick! You're evil!

1188
01:19:36,933 --> 01:19:39,811
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.

1189
01:19:40,493 --> 01:19:42,802
- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!

1190
01:19:43,013 --> 01:19:46,403
That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.

1191
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:49,007
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me...

1192
01:19:49,173 --> 01:19:51,562
...taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.

1193
01:19:51,733 --> 01:19:55,169
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.

1194
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:57,164
But then something happened.

1195
01:19:57,333 --> 01:19:59,642
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.

1196
01:19:59,813 --> 01:20:02,566
Shut up! I don't want to hear your lies!

1197
01:20:02,733 --> 01:20:06,328
Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.

1198
01:20:06,493 --> 01:20:08,165
Yes, I created a lie.

1199
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:11,803
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.

1200
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:15,204
- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.

1201
01:20:15,373 --> 01:20:18,331
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.

1202
01:20:18,493 --> 01:20:20,961
I can't feel anything anymore!

1203
01:20:21,133 --> 01:20:24,728
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.

1204
01:20:25,853 --> 01:20:27,571
I can't... Can't breathe.

1205
01:20:28,093 --> 01:20:32,245
Asthma. When I was little...

1206
01:20:34,253 --> 01:20:35,766
Listen to me, Evey.

1207
01:20:36,413 --> 01:20:39,371
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.

1208
01:20:41,373 --> 01:20:44,763
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.

1209
01:20:45,693 --> 01:20:48,412
They put you in a cell
and took everything they could take...

1210
01:20:48,573 --> 01:20:50,564
...except your life.

1211
01:20:50,733 --> 01:20:53,486
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?

1212
01:20:53,653 --> 01:20:56,292
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.

1213
01:20:56,453 --> 01:20:59,968
- Oh, please.
- You found something else.

1214
01:21:00,133 --> 01:21:03,808
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.

1215
01:21:03,973 --> 01:21:07,170
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave what they wanted...

1216
01:21:08,053 --> 01:21:10,089
...you told them you'd rather die.

1217
01:21:10,613 --> 01:21:12,092
You faced your death, Evey.

1218
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:15,087
You were calm. You were still.

1219
01:21:15,253 --> 01:21:17,562
Try to feel now what you felt then.

1220
01:21:23,493 --> 01:21:25,370
Oh, God.

1221
01:21:27,773 --> 01:21:29,047
I felt...

1222
01:21:29,693 --> 01:21:31,046
Yes?

1223
01:21:32,933 --> 01:21:34,685
I'm dizzy.

1224
01:21:34,853 --> 01:21:36,844
I need air.

1225
01:21:37,013 --> 01:21:40,130
Please, I need to be outside.

1226
01:21:40,293 --> 01:21:42,249
There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.

1227
01:22:00,093 --> 01:22:01,492
God is in the rain.

1228
01:23:03,613 --> 01:23:04,966
V.

1229
01:23:05,973 --> 01:23:07,372
I'm leaving.

1230
01:23:09,733 --> 01:23:13,123
There are 872 songs in here.

1231
01:23:14,013 --> 01:23:17,050
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.

1232
01:23:17,213 --> 01:23:20,205
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

1233
01:23:20,373 --> 01:23:21,772
I can't stay here.

1234
01:23:23,253 --> 01:23:24,732
I know.

1235
01:23:25,933 --> 01:23:29,243
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.

1236
01:23:30,173 --> 01:23:32,243
I thought about keeping this...

1237
01:23:32,413 --> 01:23:35,769
...but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.

1238
01:23:41,533 --> 01:23:42,886
I didn't.

1239
01:23:44,973 --> 01:23:46,964
May I show you something
before you go?

1240
01:23:57,293 --> 01:23:59,761
- She was real.
- Yes.

1241
01:23:59,933 --> 01:24:01,605
She's beautiful.

1242
01:24:02,693 --> 01:24:04,763
- Did you know her?
- No.

1243
01:24:05,133 --> 01:24:07,488
She wrote the letter
just before she died.

1244
01:24:07,653 --> 01:24:10,406
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.

1245
01:24:10,733 --> 01:24:12,405
Then it really happened, didn't it?

1246
01:24:13,093 --> 01:24:15,527
- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.

1247
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,487
And that's what this is all about.

1248
01:24:20,653 --> 01:24:23,645
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.

1249
01:24:24,253 --> 01:24:27,370
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.

1250
01:24:27,533 --> 01:24:29,330
It's a basic principle of the universe...

1251
01:24:29,493 --> 01:24:32,326
...that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.

1252
01:24:32,493 --> 01:24:33,812
Is that how you see it?

1253
01:24:33,973 --> 01:24:36,328
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.

1254
01:24:36,493 --> 01:24:38,484
And they created a monster.

1255
01:24:48,653 --> 01:24:51,611
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.

1256
01:24:52,613 --> 01:24:55,127
That would have scared me before...

1257
01:24:55,293 --> 01:24:56,931
...but I suppose I should thank you.

1258
01:25:08,013 --> 01:25:09,605
Thank you.

1259
01:25:12,013 --> 01:25:13,571
Goodbye.

1260
01:25:15,653 --> 01:25:17,291
Evey...

1261
01:25:18,253 --> 01:25:21,086
...may I ask you for something?

1262
01:25:21,253 --> 01:25:25,849
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once...

1263
01:25:26,053 --> 01:25:27,691
...before the 5th.

1264
01:25:30,013 --> 01:25:32,368
- All right.
- Thank you.

1265
01:25:53,653 --> 01:25:56,326
Chancellor, I know no one seems
to want to discuss this...

1266
01:25:56,493 --> 01:25:58,802
...but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality...

1267
01:25:58,973 --> 01:26:01,771
...then it can't be ignored any longer.

1268
01:26:01,933 --> 01:26:06,245
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.

1269
01:26:06,413 --> 01:26:07,812
Now, it concludes that...

1270
01:26:07,973 --> 01:26:11,204
...the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use...

1271
01:26:11,373 --> 01:26:13,682
...would be an airborne attack.

1272
01:26:13,853 --> 01:26:15,411
A separate report has been filed...

1273
01:26:15,573 --> 01:26:19,248
...suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament...

1274
01:26:19,413 --> 01:26:20,926
...have been sealed shut.

1275
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,970
<i>Who filed that report?</i>

1276
01:26:24,093 --> 01:26:25,606
Chief Inspector Finch.

1277
01:26:25,773 --> 01:26:28,526
<i>Do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?</i>

1278
01:26:28,733 --> 01:26:31,167
No, sir. Just a feeling.

1279
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:33,210
<i>If I am sure of anything, inspector...</i>

1280
01:26:33,373 --> 01:26:37,366
<i>...it is that this government won't survive
if it is to be subject to your feelings.</i>

1281
01:26:37,533 --> 01:26:40,331
<i>Mr. Dascomb,
what we need right now...</i>

1282
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:43,451
<i>...is a clear message
to the people of this country.</i>

1283
01:26:43,613 --> 01:26:45,843
<i>This message must be read
in every newspaper...</i>

1284
01:26:46,013 --> 01:26:48,447
<i>...heard on every radio,
seen on every television.</i>

1285
01:26:48,613 --> 01:26:52,492
<i>This message must resound
throughout the entire InterLink!</i>

1286
01:26:52,653 --> 01:26:55,884
<i>I want this country to realize
that we stand on the edge of oblivion.</i>

1287
01:26:56,053 --> 01:27:00,171
<i>I want every man, woman and child to
understand how close we are to chaos.</i>

1288
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:02,164
<i>I want everyone...</i>

1289
01:27:02,373 --> 01:27:05,922
<i>...to remember why they need us!</i>

1290
01:27:06,093 --> 01:27:10,405
<i>In the former United States, civil war
continues to devastate the Midwest.</i>

1291
01:27:10,573 --> 01:27:14,725
<i>Scientists attribute this water shortage
to the lack of rainfall the last two years.</i>

1292
01:27:14,893 --> 01:27:17,885
<i>Ministry officials expect
water coupon prices to rise.</i>

1293
01:27:18,093 --> 01:27:19,924
<i>Police have arrested nine suspects...</i>

1294
01:27:20,093 --> 01:27:23,688
Can you believe this shit?
Been going on all summer.

1295
01:27:23,853 --> 01:27:27,687
<i>Outside the quarantine zone, a new
airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.</i>

1296
01:27:28,173 --> 01:27:32,007
<i>Authorities uncovered new evidence
linking the terrorist organization called V...</i>

1297
01:27:32,493 --> 01:27:36,281
<i>...to the St. Mary's viral attack
on London 14 years ago.</i>

1298
01:27:47,813 --> 01:27:50,247
My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.

1299
01:27:50,573 --> 01:27:52,211
There were three men.

1300
01:27:52,373 --> 01:27:54,091
Covert intel.

1301
01:27:54,253 --> 01:27:56,448
Original black-baggers, all under Creedy.

1302
01:27:57,453 --> 01:28:01,128
Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.

1303
01:28:01,293 --> 01:28:03,284
The day after
the St. Mary's outbreak...

1304
01:28:03,453 --> 01:28:06,729
...Percy gives his Beretta a blowjob,
Keyes dies in a fire...

1305
01:28:06,893 --> 01:28:08,326
Rookwood goes missing.

1306
01:28:08,493 --> 01:28:11,291
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.

1307
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,125
Rookwood.

1308
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:15,045
How do I know that name?

1309
01:28:21,973 --> 01:28:24,851
Shit. He must have had a hidden trip
on his file at the Finger.

1310
01:28:25,053 --> 01:28:27,203
But how'd he know it was you?

1311
01:28:28,733 --> 01:28:30,212
What do we do?

1312
01:28:31,373 --> 01:28:34,012
I'm a cop. I have to know.

1313
01:28:42,173 --> 01:28:45,370
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.

1314
01:28:46,973 --> 01:28:48,531
Still does.

1315
01:28:58,373 --> 01:29:00,284
That's close enough, inspector.

1316
01:29:01,773 --> 01:29:02,967
We're not wired.

1317
01:29:03,973 --> 01:29:07,329
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.

1318
01:29:07,493 --> 01:29:10,610
- You have information for us?
- No, you already have the information.

1319
01:29:10,773 --> 01:29:12,764
All the names and dates
are inside your head.

1320
01:29:12,933 --> 01:29:15,288
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.

1321
01:29:15,453 --> 01:29:17,364
A story can be true or false.

1322
01:29:18,013 --> 01:29:20,925
I leave such judgments to you, inspector.

1323
01:29:21,733 --> 01:29:25,009
Our story begins,
as these stories often do...

1324
01:29:25,173 --> 01:29:28,165
...with a young,
up-and-coming politician.

1325
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:32,167
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

1326
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:36,485
<i>He's completely single-minded and
has no regard for the political process.</i>

1327
01:29:36,653 --> 01:29:39,690
<i>The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry...</i>

1328
01:29:39,853 --> 01:29:42,367
<i>...and the more aggressive
his supporters become.</i>

1329
01:29:43,213 --> 01:29:48,128
<i>Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.</i>

1330
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:51,530
<i>At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons...</i>

1331
01:29:51,693 --> 01:29:54,366
<i>...and it's pursued without regard
to its cost.</i>

1332
01:29:54,533 --> 01:29:58,082
<i>However, the true goal
of this project is power.</i>

1333
01:29:58,253 --> 01:30:00,926
<i>Complete and total
hegemonic domination.</i>

1334
01:30:01,093 --> 01:30:03,527
<i>The project, however, ends violently.</i>

1335
01:30:04,893 --> 01:30:07,361
<i>But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain...</i>

1336
01:30:07,533 --> 01:30:12,323
<i>...for a new ability to wage war is born
from the blood of one of the victims.</i>

1337
01:30:12,493 --> 01:30:15,963
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can...

1338
01:30:16,133 --> 01:30:19,045
...and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.

1339
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:23,889
<i>But if your ultimate goal is power,
how best to use such a weapon?</i>

1340
01:30:24,093 --> 01:30:27,529
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

1341
01:30:28,293 --> 01:30:30,090
<i>A man seemingly
without a conscience...</i>

1342
01:30:30,253 --> 01:30:32,448
<i>...for whom the ends
always justify the means.</i>

1343
01:30:32,613 --> 01:30:36,049
<i>He suggests that their target
should not be an enemy of the country...</i>

1344
01:30:36,213 --> 01:30:38,010
<i>...but rather, the country itself.</i>

1345
01:30:38,573 --> 01:30:41,292
<i>Three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack:</i>

1346
01:30:41,453 --> 01:30:44,331
<i>A school, a tube station
and a water-treatment plant.</i>

1347
01:30:44,493 --> 01:30:46,961
<i>Several hundred die
within the first few weeks.</i>

1348
01:30:47,133 --> 01:30:49,363
Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.

1349
01:30:49,573 --> 01:30:52,087
Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread.

1350
01:30:52,253 --> 01:30:54,164
- sent destruction
through the Underground.

1351
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:58,047
<i>Fueled by the media,
fear and panic spread quickly...</i>

1352
01:30:58,213 --> 01:31:01,171
<i>...fracturing and dividing
the country until, at last...</i>

1353
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,210
<i>...the true goal comes into view.</i>

1354
01:31:03,373 --> 01:31:04,931
Before the St. Mary's crises...

1355
01:31:05,093 --> 01:31:08,972
...no one would've predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.

1356
01:31:09,133 --> 01:31:13,411
<i>And then not long after the election,
lo and behold, a miracle.</i>

1357
01:31:13,573 --> 01:31:16,007
<i>Some believed it was the work
of God himself.</i>

1358
01:31:16,173 --> 01:31:19,768
<i>But it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members...</i>

1359
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:23,050
<i>...that made them all obscenely rich.</i>

1360
01:31:23,213 --> 01:31:27,206
A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed...

1361
01:31:27,373 --> 01:31:30,524
...while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.

1362
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:36,084
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.

1363
01:31:36,253 --> 01:31:38,483
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.

1364
01:31:38,653 --> 01:31:41,167
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed...

1365
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:45,121
...to the newly created position
of high chancellor.

1366
01:31:45,293 --> 01:31:47,807
The rest, as they say, is history.

1367
01:31:49,693 --> 01:31:53,606
- Can you prove any of this?
- Why do you think I'm still alive?

1368
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:59,847
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.

1369
01:32:00,013 --> 01:32:01,810
I'm sure you would.

1370
01:32:01,973 --> 01:32:06,683
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.

1371
01:32:06,853 --> 01:32:09,686
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.

1372
01:32:09,853 --> 01:32:12,606
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing...

1373
01:32:12,773 --> 01:32:14,172
...I'll contact you again.

1374
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:16,483
Till then, cheerio.

1375
01:32:18,093 --> 01:32:19,367
Rookwood...

1376
01:32:20,973 --> 01:32:22,725
...why didn't you come forward before?

1377
01:32:23,773 --> 01:32:25,092
What were you waiting for?

1378
01:32:25,253 --> 01:32:27,369
Well, for you, inspector.

1379
01:32:27,533 --> 01:32:29,251
I needed you.

1380
01:32:55,373 --> 01:32:57,409
What's he doing in the dark there?

1381
01:32:57,573 --> 01:33:00,007
Creepy Creedy. Not sure I wanna know.

1382
01:33:00,173 --> 01:33:03,609
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?

1383
01:33:03,773 --> 01:33:05,843
And we both know why.

1384
01:33:06,493 --> 01:33:08,768
After I destroy Parliament...

1385
01:33:08,933 --> 01:33:12,642
...his only chance will be to offer them
someone else, some other piece of meat.

1386
01:33:12,813 --> 01:33:14,007
And who will that be?

1387
01:33:14,253 --> 01:33:16,323
You, Mr. Creedy.

1388
01:33:16,493 --> 01:33:19,849
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.

1389
01:33:20,013 --> 01:33:23,642
A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.

1390
01:33:23,813 --> 01:33:26,850
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.

1391
01:33:27,013 --> 01:33:29,402
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now...

1392
01:33:29,573 --> 01:33:32,246
...why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house...

1393
01:33:32,413 --> 01:33:34,881
...and a tap on every phone.
- Bollocks.

1394
01:33:35,053 --> 01:33:39,285
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.

1395
01:33:39,453 --> 01:33:42,331
- What do you want?
- Sutler.

1396
01:33:43,853 --> 01:33:46,321
Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.

1397
01:33:46,493 --> 01:33:48,404
You knew that one day
it'd be you or him.

1398
01:33:48,573 --> 01:33:51,770
That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.

1399
01:33:51,933 --> 01:33:54,970
That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler...

1400
01:33:55,133 --> 01:33:58,762
...men that can be counted on.
All you have to do is say the word.

1401
01:33:58,933 --> 01:34:01,731
- What do I get out of this deal?
- Me.

1402
01:34:03,493 --> 01:34:06,530
If you accept,
put an X on your front door.

1403
01:34:08,573 --> 01:34:10,404
Why should I trust you?

1404
01:34:10,573 --> 01:34:13,610
Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.

1405
01:34:21,213 --> 01:34:24,603
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.</i>

1406
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:27,686
<i>May we come up?</i>

1407
01:34:28,973 --> 01:34:31,123
<i>You find your own tree.</i>

1408
01:34:41,773 --> 01:34:44,492
We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.

1409
01:34:45,133 --> 01:34:47,363
Still no word. What's he waiting for?

1410
01:34:50,413 --> 01:34:52,768
Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.

1411
01:34:55,333 --> 01:34:57,210
<i>- Yeah.
- Is that Chief Inspector Finch?</i>

1412
01:34:57,373 --> 01:34:59,091
<i>- It is.
- This is Captain Clark...</i>

1413
01:34:59,253 --> 01:35:01,289
<i>...of the 137th Ward at Southend.</i>

1414
01:35:01,453 --> 01:35:02,602
<i>- We found him.
- Found who?</i>

1415
01:35:02,773 --> 01:35:04,764
<i>William Rookwood,
the one you're looking for.</i>

1416
01:35:04,933 --> 01:35:08,562
<i>I saw your report a couple weeks back,
thought I'd run it through our John Does.</i>

1417
01:35:08,733 --> 01:35:10,564
<i>I hooked him. Perfect dental match.</i>

1418
01:35:10,733 --> 01:35:14,487
<i>A floater. Fishermen picked him up.
No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.</i>

1419
01:35:14,653 --> 01:35:18,248
<i>- William Rookwood is dead?
- I'd say so. Twenty years now.</i>

1420
01:35:21,653 --> 01:35:22,802
Goddamn it!

1421
01:35:23,173 --> 01:35:25,368
That son of a bitch sat there...

1422
01:35:25,533 --> 01:35:29,082
...and spoon-fed me that bullshit,
and I ate it up!

1423
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:31,810
So, what do we do now, inspector?

1424
01:35:31,973 --> 01:35:34,248
We do what we should have been doing.

1425
01:35:34,973 --> 01:35:36,201
We find him.

1426
01:35:57,093 --> 01:35:59,846
<i>Every day, gentlemen.</i>

1427
01:36:00,013 --> 01:36:03,892
<i>Every day that brings us closer
to November...</i>

1428
01:36:04,053 --> 01:36:06,692
<i>...every day that man remains free...</i>

1429
01:36:07,053 --> 01:36:09,442
<i>...is one more failure.</i>

1430
01:36:09,613 --> 01:36:11,922
<i>Three hundred and forty-seven days,
gentlemen.</i>

1431
01:36:12,093 --> 01:36:14,402
<i>Three hundred and forty-seven failures!</i>

1432
01:36:14,573 --> 01:36:17,133
Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force...

1433
01:36:17,293 --> 01:36:20,171
<i>We are being buried
beneath the avalanche...</i>

1434
01:36:20,333 --> 01:36:23,166
<i>...of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!</i>

1435
01:36:39,813 --> 01:36:40,962
I'll get it.

1436
01:36:42,293 --> 01:36:44,488
- Eric Finch?
- Yeah.

1437
01:36:49,173 --> 01:36:50,367
Bloody hell.

1438
01:36:52,053 --> 01:36:53,611
How many went out?

1439
01:36:53,773 --> 01:36:55,411
So far we count eight boxcars.

1440
01:36:55,573 --> 01:36:58,246
- Several hundred thousand, at least.
- Christ.

1441
01:36:59,773 --> 01:37:03,686
<i>I want anyone caught
with one of those masks arrested!</i>

1442
01:37:03,853 --> 01:37:06,526
Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!

1443
01:37:06,693 --> 01:37:09,571
We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.

1444
01:37:10,253 --> 01:37:12,562
- This is exactly what he wants.
- What?

1445
01:37:12,733 --> 01:37:16,282
- Anarchy in the UK!
- Chaos.

1446
01:37:16,453 --> 01:37:21,447
<i>Mr. Creedy, I am holding you
personally responsible for this situation.</i>

1447
01:37:23,813 --> 01:37:28,011
<i>The problem is that he knows us
better than we know ourselves.</i>

1448
01:37:29,693 --> 01:37:32,730
That's why I went to Larkhill
last night.

1449
01:37:32,893 --> 01:37:36,169
- That's outside quarantine.
- I had to see it.

1450
01:37:37,773 --> 01:37:39,365
<i>There wasn't much left.</i>

1451
01:37:40,293 --> 01:37:43,330
<i>But when I was there, it was strange.</i>

1452
01:37:43,493 --> 01:37:47,008
I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.

1453
01:37:52,453 --> 01:37:54,011
Like I could see the whole thing.

1454
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:59,009
<i>One long chain of events that stretched
all the way back before Larkhill.</i>

1455
01:38:00,973 --> 01:38:04,170
I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...

1456
01:38:10,053 --> 01:38:11,930
...and everything that
was going to happen.

1457
01:38:12,573 --> 01:38:14,052
Hey, you!

1458
01:38:16,013 --> 01:38:20,131
It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...

1459
01:38:21,413 --> 01:38:23,802
...and I realized that
we were all a part of it...

1460
01:38:28,213 --> 01:38:29,931
...and all trapped by it.

1461
01:38:37,013 --> 01:38:38,810
So do you know what's gonna happen?

1462
01:38:39,573 --> 01:38:42,531
No. It was a feeling.

1463
01:38:44,453 --> 01:38:46,011
But I can guess.

1464
01:38:47,893 --> 01:38:51,283
With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.

1465
01:38:55,413 --> 01:38:56,926
And when they do...

1466
01:38:57,093 --> 01:38:58,970
...things will turn nasty.

1467
01:39:12,973 --> 01:39:14,611
<i>Rioters were arrested in Brixton.</i>

1468
01:39:14,813 --> 01:39:19,045
And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.

1469
01:39:22,093 --> 01:39:27,213
At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.

1470
01:39:28,453 --> 01:39:29,727
And then...

1471
01:40:31,333 --> 01:40:33,847
Tonight's your big night.

1472
01:40:34,813 --> 01:40:36,451
You ready for it?

1473
01:40:38,613 --> 01:40:40,649
Are we ready for it?

1474
01:41:12,533 --> 01:41:14,091
I missed this song.

1475
01:41:14,973 --> 01:41:16,964
I didn't think you'd come.

1476
01:41:17,973 --> 01:41:19,372
I said I would.

1477
01:41:23,133 --> 01:41:24,646
You look well.

1478
01:41:24,813 --> 01:41:26,212
Thank you.

1479
01:41:27,773 --> 01:41:32,130
May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?

1480
01:41:32,293 --> 01:41:35,126
A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.

1481
01:41:36,653 --> 01:41:40,441
I must confess, every time
I heard a siren, I worried about you.

1482
01:41:40,613 --> 01:41:43,810
I worried about myself for a while.

1483
01:41:43,973 --> 01:41:46,612
But then, one day, I was at a market...

1484
01:41:46,773 --> 01:41:50,686
...and a friend, someone I had worked
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.

1485
01:41:51,813 --> 01:41:55,806
I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.

1486
01:41:57,013 --> 01:41:59,288
My friend picked it up...

1487
01:41:59,453 --> 01:42:01,444
...and handed it to me.

1488
01:42:02,093 --> 01:42:04,368
She looked at me right in the eyes...

1489
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:07,130
...didn't recognize me.

1490
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:12,331
Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.

1491
01:42:18,053 --> 01:42:20,487
I have a gift for you, Evey...

1492
01:42:20,653 --> 01:42:25,443
...but before I give it to you,
I'd like to ask you something.

1493
01:42:25,613 --> 01:42:28,446
Would you dance with me?

1494
01:42:29,453 --> 01:42:32,809
Now? On the eve of your revolution?

1495
01:42:32,973 --> 01:42:36,329
A revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.

1496
01:42:37,853 --> 01:42:39,047
I'd love to.

1497
01:42:40,453 --> 01:42:43,445
<i>Tonight, I will speak directly
to these people...</i>

1498
01:42:43,613 --> 01:42:45,922
<i>...and make the situation
perfectly clear to them.</i>

1499
01:42:46,093 --> 01:42:51,451
<i>The security of this nation depends
on complete and total compliance.</i>

1500
01:42:51,613 --> 01:42:55,970
<i>Tonight, any protestor,
any instigator or agitator...</i>

1501
01:42:56,133 --> 01:42:58,727
<i>...will be made example of!</i>

1502
01:43:00,933 --> 01:43:03,766
Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.

1503
01:43:03,933 --> 01:43:05,685
<i>And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?</i>

1504
01:43:05,853 --> 01:43:07,969
<i>- Should the terrorist succeed...
- He won't.</i>

1505
01:43:08,133 --> 01:43:11,523
I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does...

1506
01:43:11,693 --> 01:43:15,288
<i>If he does, and something happens
to that building...</i>

1507
01:43:15,453 --> 01:43:18,570
<i>...the only thing that will change,
the only difference it will make...</i>

1508
01:43:18,733 --> 01:43:21,372
<i>...is that tomorrow morning,
instead of a newspaper...</i>

1509
01:43:21,533 --> 01:43:25,242
<i>...I will be reading
Mr. Creedy's resignation!</i>

1510
01:43:29,893 --> 01:43:33,852
You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.

1511
01:43:34,013 --> 01:43:37,926
I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.

1512
01:43:38,093 --> 01:43:39,685
It's nearly time.

1513
01:43:39,853 --> 01:43:42,413
The masks were ingenious.

1514
01:43:42,573 --> 01:43:45,292
It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.

1515
01:43:45,453 --> 01:43:48,445
Conceal me what I am,
and be my aid...

1516
01:43:48,613 --> 01:43:51,844
...for such disguise as haply
shall become the form of my intent.

1517
01:43:52,013 --> 01:43:54,732
<i>- Twelfth Night.
- Viola.</i>

1518
01:43:54,893 --> 01:43:57,532
- I don't understand.
- What?

1519
01:43:57,693 --> 01:44:00,969
How you can be one of the most
important things that's happened to me...

1520
01:44:01,133 --> 01:44:03,442
...and yet I know
almost nothing about you.

1521
01:44:03,613 --> 01:44:06,286
I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were...

1522
01:44:06,453 --> 01:44:08,808
...if you had any brothers or sisters.

1523
01:44:08,973 --> 01:44:11,965
I don't even know
what you really look like.

1524
01:44:12,133 --> 01:44:14,089
Evey, please.

1525
01:44:15,253 --> 01:44:17,369
There is a face beneath this mask...

1526
01:44:17,533 --> 01:44:19,285
...but it's not me.

1527
01:44:19,453 --> 01:44:22,684
I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it...

1528
01:44:22,853 --> 01:44:24,445
...or the bones beneath them.

1529
01:44:26,573 --> 01:44:27,767
I understand.

1530
01:44:28,933 --> 01:44:30,446
Thank you.

1531
01:44:31,173 --> 01:44:32,845
There isn't much time.

1532
01:44:33,013 --> 01:44:35,083
I have something I must give you.

1533
01:44:35,413 --> 01:44:37,369
I went by Parliament.

1534
01:44:37,533 --> 01:44:42,163
Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.

1535
01:44:43,013 --> 01:44:45,811
Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.

1536
01:44:47,693 --> 01:44:50,253
But if they do,
what do you think will happen?

1537
01:44:50,973 --> 01:44:53,441
What usually happens
when people without guns...

1538
01:44:53,613 --> 01:44:56,173
...stand up to people with guns.

1539
01:44:57,413 --> 01:44:58,402
Pull over here.

1540
01:44:58,573 --> 01:45:01,929
We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?

1541
01:45:05,173 --> 01:45:06,526
Inspector.

1542
01:45:07,293 --> 01:45:09,090
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?

1543
01:45:17,533 --> 01:45:21,162
The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.

1544
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:22,527
They did.

1545
01:45:22,693 --> 01:45:26,322
It took nearly 10 years to
clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own.

1546
01:45:28,213 --> 01:45:29,692
Let me show you.

1547
01:45:45,173 --> 01:45:46,970
These tracks lead to Parliament.

1548
01:45:47,253 --> 01:45:48,606
Yes.

1549
01:45:49,293 --> 01:45:51,204
Then it's really going to happen, isn't it?

1550
01:45:51,373 --> 01:45:54,524
It will if you want it to.

1551
01:45:55,013 --> 01:45:57,049
- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.

1552
01:45:57,613 --> 01:46:02,846
Everything that I have: my home,
my books, the gallery, this train...

1553
01:46:03,013 --> 01:46:05,846
...I'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.

1554
01:46:06,013 --> 01:46:07,366
Is this another trick, V?

1555
01:46:07,533 --> 01:46:11,685
No. No more tricks. No more lies.

1556
01:46:11,853 --> 01:46:13,684
Only truth.

1557
01:46:13,853 --> 01:46:16,890
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong...

1558
01:46:17,373 --> 01:46:22,083
...that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.

1559
01:46:22,253 --> 01:46:24,926
- Why?
- Because this world...

1560
01:46:25,093 --> 01:46:29,371
...the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.

1561
01:46:30,373 --> 01:46:32,329
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin...

1562
01:46:32,493 --> 01:46:37,362
...that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.

1563
01:46:40,253 --> 01:46:42,084
Where are you going?

1564
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:44,563
The time has come for me
to meet my maker...

1565
01:46:44,733 --> 01:46:47,930
...and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.

1566
01:46:48,093 --> 01:46:50,732
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.

1567
01:46:50,893 --> 01:46:53,361
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.

1568
01:46:53,533 --> 01:46:56,366
No. You were right about what I am.

1569
01:46:56,813 --> 01:46:58,724
I have no tree waiting for me.

1570
01:46:59,173 --> 01:47:03,485
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.

1571
01:47:03,653 --> 01:47:05,325
That's not true.

1572
01:47:30,853 --> 01:47:32,172
I can't.

1573
01:47:40,853 --> 01:47:42,411
<i>My fellow Englishmen...</i>

1574
01:47:42,973 --> 01:47:44,884
<i>...tonight, our country...</i>

1575
01:47:45,053 --> 01:47:46,532
<i>...that which we stand for...</i>

1576
01:47:46,733 --> 01:47:48,246
<i>...and all that we hold dear...</i>

1577
01:47:48,413 --> 01:47:52,008
<i>...faces a grave and terrible threat.</i>

1578
01:47:52,173 --> 01:47:53,606
The area's clean, sir.

1579
01:47:54,173 --> 01:47:57,768
<i>This violent and unparalleled assault
to our security...</i>

1580
01:47:57,933 --> 01:47:59,651
<i>...will not go undefended.</i>

1581
01:47:59,813 --> 01:48:01,007
Where is he?

1582
01:48:01,173 --> 01:48:02,162
<i>Or unpunished.</i>

1583
01:48:02,333 --> 01:48:04,403
Penny for the Guy.

1584
01:48:04,573 --> 01:48:08,407
<i>Our enemy is an insidious one,
seeking to divide us...</i>

1585
01:48:08,973 --> 01:48:13,251
<i>...and destroy the very foundation
of our great nation.</i>

1586
01:48:13,413 --> 01:48:17,292
I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?

1587
01:48:17,453 --> 01:48:18,568
Bring him down.

1588
01:48:18,733 --> 01:48:20,883
<i>Tonight we must remain steadfast.</i>

1589
01:48:21,373 --> 01:48:23,125
<i>We must remain determined.</i>

1590
01:48:23,293 --> 01:48:26,365
<i>But most of all,
we must remain united.</i>

1591
01:48:29,493 --> 01:48:32,963
<i>Those caught tonight
in violation of curfew...</i>

1592
01:48:33,133 --> 01:48:35,693
<i>...will be considered in league
with our enemy...</i>

1593
01:48:35,853 --> 01:48:38,970
<i>...and prosecuted as a terrorist
without leniency or exception.</i>

1594
01:48:39,133 --> 01:48:40,566
I want to see his face.

1595
01:48:40,733 --> 01:48:44,043
<i>Tonight I give you
my most solemn vow...</i>

1596
01:48:44,213 --> 01:48:46,522
<i>...that justice will be swift...</i>

1597
01:48:46,693 --> 01:48:49,048
<i>...it will be righteous...</i>

1598
01:48:49,213 --> 01:48:51,363
<i>...and it will be without mercy.</i>

1599
01:48:53,453 --> 01:48:55,523
Oh, God. No.

1600
01:48:55,693 --> 01:48:59,447
At last, we finally meet.

1601
01:49:01,893 --> 01:49:04,168
I have something for you, chancellor.

1602
01:49:04,413 --> 01:49:06,131
A farewell gift.

1603
01:49:06,293 --> 01:49:09,763
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done...

1604
01:49:09,933 --> 01:49:11,844
...and for the only thing you have left.

1605
01:49:14,093 --> 01:49:15,970
Goodbye, chancellor.

1606
01:49:16,933 --> 01:49:18,082
Mr. Creedy.

1607
01:49:20,333 --> 01:49:22,051
Disgusting.

1608
01:49:34,293 --> 01:49:36,329
Now that's done with...

1609
01:49:36,493 --> 01:49:40,168
...it's time to have a look at your face.

1610
01:49:40,693 --> 01:49:42,172
Take off your mask.

1611
01:49:42,453 --> 01:49:43,647
No.

1612
01:49:58,413 --> 01:50:00,005
Defiant to the end, huh?

1613
01:50:01,893 --> 01:50:05,329
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.

1614
01:50:05,493 --> 01:50:06,608
You're like me.

1615
01:50:06,773 --> 01:50:11,005
The only thing you and I have in common,
Mr. Creedy, is we're both about to die.

1616
01:50:12,573 --> 01:50:14,245
How do you imagine
that's gonna happen?

1617
01:50:14,533 --> 01:50:16,649
With my hands around your neck.

1618
01:50:18,813 --> 01:50:19,882
Bollocks.

1619
01:50:20,973 --> 01:50:23,089
What are you gonna do, huh?

1620
01:50:23,253 --> 01:50:25,289
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.

1621
01:50:25,453 --> 01:50:29,651
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.

1622
01:50:29,813 --> 01:50:31,326
We have guns.

1623
01:50:31,493 --> 01:50:34,610
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty...

1624
01:50:34,773 --> 01:50:36,809
...I'm no longer standing,
because if I am...

1625
01:50:37,613 --> 01:50:39,649
...you'll all be dead
before you've reloaded.

1626
01:50:39,973 --> 01:50:42,043
That's impossible!

1627
01:50:44,333 --> 01:50:45,368
Kill him.

1628
01:51:09,013 --> 01:51:10,082
My turn.

1629
01:52:18,813 --> 01:52:20,929
Die! Die!

1630
01:52:21,773 --> 01:52:23,843
Why won't you die?!

1631
01:52:24,773 --> 01:52:26,092
Why won't you die?

1632
01:52:27,853 --> 01:52:30,845
Beneath this mask
there is more than flesh.

1633
01:52:31,013 --> 01:52:33,686
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.

1634
01:52:35,013 --> 01:52:37,129
And ideas are bulletproof.

1635
01:53:26,733 --> 01:53:29,691
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.

1636
01:53:29,853 --> 01:53:31,047
This is General Ackroyd.

1637
01:53:31,493 --> 01:53:32,972
Keep communication tight.

1638
01:53:33,133 --> 01:53:36,250
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.

1639
01:53:40,013 --> 01:53:41,287
V!

1640
01:53:45,733 --> 01:53:48,167
Oh, God, we have to stop your bleeding.

1641
01:53:48,333 --> 01:53:52,292
Please, don't. I'm finished and glad of it.

1642
01:53:52,653 --> 01:53:54,211
Don't say that.

1643
01:53:54,693 --> 01:53:57,446
I told you, only truth.

1644
01:54:00,813 --> 01:54:04,123
For 20 years I sought only this day.

1645
01:54:04,293 --> 01:54:06,329
Nothing else existed...

1646
01:54:08,333 --> 01:54:10,244
...until I saw you.

1647
01:54:11,373 --> 01:54:13,523
Then everything changed.

1648
01:54:14,893 --> 01:54:16,724
I fell in love with you, Evey...

1649
01:54:18,253 --> 01:54:21,290
...like I no longer believed I could.

1650
01:54:21,453 --> 01:54:23,842
V, I don't want you to die.

1651
01:54:26,493 --> 01:54:30,088
That's the most beautiful thing...

1652
01:54:30,253 --> 01:54:32,767
...you could have ever given me.

1653
01:54:40,013 --> 01:54:41,412
V?

1654
01:54:42,573 --> 01:54:43,801
V?!

1655
01:54:53,853 --> 01:54:56,651
Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading to Trafalgar Square.

1656
01:54:56,813 --> 01:54:58,769
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.

1657
01:55:29,693 --> 01:55:31,684
Hold it. Stop right there.

1658
01:55:34,973 --> 01:55:36,406
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?

1659
01:55:44,093 --> 01:55:45,287
Then it's over?

1660
01:55:45,773 --> 01:55:46,922
Almost.

1661
01:55:47,093 --> 01:55:49,448
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.

1662
01:55:51,693 --> 01:55:52,728
No.

1663
01:55:53,493 --> 01:55:55,768
Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.

1664
01:55:55,933 --> 01:55:58,083
- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.

1665
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:01,683
Or from Party Leader Creedy.

1666
01:56:01,853 --> 01:56:03,081
Or from the high chancellor.

1667
01:56:03,973 --> 01:56:05,122
Why are you doing this?

1668
01:56:05,653 --> 01:56:07,928
- Because he was right.
- About what?

1669
01:56:08,093 --> 01:56:12,405
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.

1670
01:56:17,253 --> 01:56:19,642
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!

1671
01:56:45,333 --> 01:56:47,642
Jesus bloody Christ.

1672
01:57:11,893 --> 01:57:12,962
It's time.

1673
01:57:33,453 --> 01:57:34,727
Tell me...

1674
01:57:35,693 --> 01:57:38,082
...do you like music, Mr. Finch?

1675
01:57:56,893 --> 01:57:58,804
That music?

1676
01:57:59,293 --> 01:58:00,646
Yes.

1677
01:58:01,093 --> 01:58:02,572
His music.

1678
01:58:33,213 --> 01:58:34,726
Who was he?

1679
01:58:35,933 --> 01:58:37,127
He was Edmond Dantes.

1680
01:58:39,213 --> 01:58:41,488
And he was my father...

1681
01:58:41,653 --> 01:58:43,530
...and my mother.

1682
01:58:44,373 --> 01:58:45,772
My brother.

1683
01:58:47,693 --> 01:58:49,445
My friend.

1684
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:52,284
He was you...

1685
01:58:54,253 --> 01:58:55,686
...and me.

1686
01:58:57,693 --> 01:58:59,490
He was all of us.

1687
01:59:27,773 --> 01:59:30,082
<i>No one will ever forget that night...</i>

1688
01:59:30,253 --> 01:59:32,813
<i>...and what it meant for this country.</i>

1689
01:59:33,293 --> 01:59:35,602
<i>But I will never forget the man...</i>

1690
01:59:35,773 --> 01:59:37,365
<i>...and what he meant to me.</i>
